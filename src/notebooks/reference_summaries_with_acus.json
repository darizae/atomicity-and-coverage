Gary Gardner (left) will report to Aston Villa for pre-season training to be assessed by Tim Sherwood . The Villa boss has inspired the club since being appointed and helped lead them to an FA Cup final . Gardner, born in Solihull, joined Villa's academy aged seven and last year was rewarded with a new contract that expires in June 2016 despite suffering serious knee injuries. 'I will go back to Villa in the summer and we will see what happens,' he said. 'When I am back there in training, it will be my chance to impress. Tim Sherwood will not have seen much of me in training, because I have not been there. 'Villa are the main club, I have been there since I was seven and it is the team I support. But Forest have been fantastic to me. It is definitely the second team in my heart.

For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no\u00a0evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that\u00a0reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.",

    "source": "It is the smallest computer in the world - and 150 of them can fit in a thimble. Called the\u00a0Michigan Micro Mote, to tiny technology is a complete computer system. Its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor, and give everyday objects computing capabilities. The Michigan Micro Mote is the smallest computer in the world, measuring less than 2mm across. The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. By strobing light at a high frequency, the operator is able to send information to the computer. Once the Micro Mote processes the data, it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies. The Michigan Micro Mote is the first complete, operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across. 'To be 'complete,' a computer system must have an input of data, the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it, make decisions about what to do next \u2013 and ultimately, the ability to output the data.' Professor David\u00a0Blaauw explained. 'The sensors are the input and the radios are the output. The other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power.' The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. They are the culmination of work initiated by Blaauw and Sylvester on very low-power processing for millimeter-scale systems. A key breakthrough in the size/power matchup came with the Phoenix processor in 2008. The Phoenix processor is miniscule at 915 x 915\u00b5m2, and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only 500pW. (Consider that 1pW is the average power consumption of a single human cell.) Blaauw explained why Phoenix's extreme energy efficiency is so important: 'As you shrink down in size, the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery. 'It's actually not hard to make chips small, but it is hard to make them low power. 'We could have very small chips, but we'd still end up with really large batteries.' This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information, its inventors say. The solar system allows the computer to work \u00a0under indoor lights without ever having to be charged. 'With a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nW, the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually,' the team say. The device's standby power consumption is 2nA. That's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby, or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field. There are currently three different systems in the M3 family, focusing on several different applications: sensing temperature, pressure, and taking images. 'Down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another,' says Blaauw, 'and we're currently working to extend their range to about 20m.' The working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information. Numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home, business, or personal device. 'We found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices, and that's why we went with the modular or stacked approach.' Blaauw explained. 'It's the key aspect of our design. If you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys.'",

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences. Information about penalty points for traffic violations such as speeding will be held only on the DVLA\u2019s database, and will have to be checked online, by phone or by post. But motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist\u2019s details. Scroll down for video . Changes: Britons heading to Europe on holiday are facing the nightmare of arriving at their destination and not being able to hire a car, thanks to a controversial driving licence (file picture) shake-up . Concerns: Motoring groups fear the switch to a fully online system will make it more difficult for car hire firms which want to check a motorist\u2019s details . From June 8, holidaymakers heading abroad will have to log on to the DVLA website the day before and put in their driving licence number to obtain a special code to give to their car hire company when they arrive at the desk. But fears are growing that the \u2018muddled\u2019 introduction of the new rules will mean people could be turned away because many car hire firms abroad will still insist on examining the paper document to check for endorsements or bans. Furthermore, the passcode is valid for only 72 hours, meaning anyone hiring a car in the second week of their trip faces having to find an internet cafe or pay expensive roaming charges. Mark Bower, of the car hire insurance website MoneyMaxim, said holidaymakers could endure major problems at car hire desks across Europe. He added: \u2018Most people are simply unaware that these changes are on the way \u2013 and it is not just renters. \u2018I spoke to one big car hire firm in Portugal this week and they knew nothing of the changes. Six weeks away from implementation, the whole thing is very muddled. \u2018It is another thing you have to remember to do just before departure. Or you can do it at the desk with your smartphone if you can remember the website address, don\u2019t mind the data roaming charges, can remember your national insurance number and are impervious to the long queue developing behind you.\u2019 The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is scrapping the paper counterpart that accompanies all UK plastic photocard licences (file picture) Mr Bower also said unscrupulous firms might use the issue as \u2018another excuse\u2019 to persuade people to pay for extra insurance. Motorists will also be able to download their driving history as a printable PDF file, although it is unclear whether all car hire firms will accept that, or how drivers without access to a computer will cope. The DVLA insists the changes have been widely publicised. But consumers booking car hire for holidays after June have not been warned the new rules are being introduced. The terms and conditions of most car hire firms still explicitly state that paper counterparts must be produced. The British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, which represents the industry, says UK hirers unaware of the rule change will be treated in the same way as those who currently turn up without both parts of the licence. The DVLA said the system, called Share Driving Licence, would be ready in time for June 8. A spokesman said: \u2018There is up-to-date information on the website and we are working closely with the industry to ensure that their systems and processes are ready for the changes.\u2019 The two-part licence was introduced in 1998 but many drivers found it inconvenient. From June 8, paper counterparts will be invalid and should be destroyed. Motorists with old-style paper driving licences from before 1998 can continue to use them.",

An incredible video has stitched together footage from a Nasa spacecraft, revealed the beauty of the solar surface as it bursts with energy. Taken over five years, the footage includes plasma raining down on the sun, an extreme solar eruption and even a comet breezing through the sun\u2019s atmosphere. Scroll down for video . Filmmaker Michael K\u00f6nig from Cologne, Germany has created an amazing video showing solar activity (shown). It was made by stitching together footage from Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory over five years . The movie, called Sun, was created by filmmaker Michael K\u00f6nig from Cologne, Germany. It uses footage recorded by Nasa\u2019s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft between 2011 and 2015. \u2018This montage features excerpts of 4K full-disk pictures in extreme ultraviolet channels,\u2019 explained Mr K\u00f6nig, and it \u2018offers a glance at spicules, solar flares, filaments and an overview of the sun\u2019s atmosphere.\u2019 Highlights of the video include large, bright tendrils extending outward from the sun\u2019s surface and occasionally crashing down again - known as solar prominences. Other fantastic sections show bright, active regions on the sun\u2019s surface as magnetic fields send it into turmoil. Transits of the moon, Venus and Earth across the sun, as observed from the SDO, are also seen, while towards the end of the video Comet Lovejoy can be seen passing the sun in December 2011. Another incredible part of the video shows \u2018coronal rain\u2019 streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun\u2019s surface. Coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun\u2019s atmosphere - cools and condenses in strong magnetic fields. The plasma is attracted to the magnetic fields and condenses, slowly falling back to the solar surface over several hours. Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), illustrated below, was launched on 11 February 2010 and has observed the sun ever since. It's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around Earth. By watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona, which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun, what heats the sun's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface, and why the sun's magnetic fields are constantly on the move. SDO also measures fluctuations in the sun's extreme ultraviolet output, which provides the majority of energy for heating Earth's upper atmosphere. Five years into its mission, SDO continues to send back tantalizing imagery to incite scientists' curiosity. For example, in late 2014, SDO captured imagery of the largest sun spots seen since 1995 as well as a torrent of intense solar flares. Another incredible part of the video shows \u2018coronal rain\u2019 (pictured) streaming down onto the sun from a loop of material above the sun\u2019s surface. Coronal rain is formed when hot plasma in the corona - the sun\u2019s atmosphere - condenses and falls back to the surface . Elsewhere, solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are seen erupting on the sun\u2019s surface, sending out huge amounts of energy. CMEs are the huge waves of material that are seen in images of the sun, and they can pose a threat to satellites in Earth orbit. Solar flares are flashes of energy on the surface of the sun, which are sometimes associated with CMEs - although their connection is not well understood. The video, though, is a reminder of just how beautiful, powerful and active our solar system\u2019s only star can be. By watching the sun in different wavelengths - and therefore different temperatures - scientists can watch how material courses through the corona, which holds clues to what causes eruptions on the sun, what heats the sun's atmosphere up to 1,000 times hotter than its surface .",

Rose arrived at Augusta National having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the PGA Tour, but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in Masters history. 'I'm really excited about the rest of the year now. It's a good momentum starter for me,' said Rose, who was looking to become the first European player to win the US Open and Masters. Justin Rose was unable to take victory at the Masters, despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . Rose believes that his finish of second at Augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . Rose wants to follow the lead of Rory McIlroy, who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . 'I tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about April to September when the big tournaments come around and that's when I want to play well. 'You look at Rory's year last year, it was all about how he played in the summer (winning the Open, Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA in the space of four weeks). I was trying to keep telling myself it's a long year. Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship. 'The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that I have not been in contention and I haven't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw. 'I was really pleased at how comfortable I felt in that situation, last group in the Masters on Sunday. I think that's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon.' Rose began the final round four shots behind Spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine, but was never able to get any closer. 'There's two ways to look at it. You can think that 14 under par, I'll take that next year and I'll take that the year after and I'll take it the year after, so I have to take a lot of confidence from that,' he added. Rose had struggled to hit top form going into the Masters but now hopes to sustain his Augusta form . Rose (left) congratulates tournament winner Spieth and praised his performance level for the week . 'But you've got to play it on the day, too. I felt like there were a few moments out there where I could have done better and I'll learn on that and think about that. 'Jordan didn't really open the door and I didn't really expect him to. Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole. I felt that if I make my birdie putt and Jordan misses for par, it's a two-shot swing and I'm two back with two to play. But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day, really.'",

    "source": "(CNN)James Best, best known for his portrayal of bumbling sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane on TV's \"The Dukes of Hazzard,\" died Monday after a brief illness. He was 88. Best died in hospice in Hickory, North Carolina, of complications from pneumonia, said Steve Latshaw, a longtime friend and Hollywood colleague. Although he'd been a busy actor for decades in theater and in Hollywood, Best didn't become famous until 1979, when \"The Dukes of Hazzard's\" cornpone charms began beaming into millions of American homes almost every Friday night. For seven seasons, Best's Rosco P. Coltrane chased the moonshine-running Duke boys back and forth across the back roads of fictitious Hazzard County, Georgia, although his \"hot pursuit\" usually ended with him crashing his patrol car. Although Rosco was slow-witted and corrupt, Best gave him a childlike enthusiasm that got laughs and made him endearing. His character became known for his distinctive \"kew-kew-kew\" chuckle and for goofy catchphrases such as \"cuff 'em and stuff 'em!\" upon making an arrest. Among the most popular shows on TV in the early '80s, \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" ran until 1985 and spawned TV movies, an animated series and video games. Several of Best's \"Hazzard\" co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media. \"I laughed and learned more from Jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year,\" co-star John Schneider, who played Bo Duke, said on Twitter. \"Give Uncle Jesse my love when you see him dear friend.\" \"Jimmy Best was the most constantly creative person I have ever known,\" said Ben Jones, who played mechanic Cooter on the show, in a Facebook post. \"Every minute of his long life was spent acting, writing, producing, painting, teaching, fishing, or involved in another of his life's many passions.\" Born Jewel Guy on July 26, 1926, in Powderly, Kentucky, Best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by Armen and Essa Best, who renamed him James and raised him in rural Indiana. Best served in the Army during World War II before launching his acting career. In the 1950s and 1960s, he accumulated scores of credits, playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such TV shows as \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" He later appeared in a handful of Burt Reynolds' movies, including \"Hooper\" and \"The End.\" But Best will always be best known for his \"Hazzard\" role, which lives on in reruns. \"Jimmie was my teacher, mentor, close friend and collaborator for 26 years,\" Latshaw said. \"I directed two of his feature films, including the recent 'Return of the Killer Shrews,' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier.\" People we've lost in 2015 .

Despite a 35-year fight to get the trees cut down to size, the council has ruled they can stay. It is the final defeat in a battle that involved two generations of Mrs Alexander\u2019s family. It kicked off 35 years ago when Mrs Alexander\u2019s aunt found her vegetable patch at the property would not grow anything worth eating because of the leylandii. A row between neighbours over a 40ft high leylandii hedge (pictured) has finally come to and end after 35 years . The battle between the neighbouring properties started in 1980 when the owner planted a vegetable patch which withered and died in the shade of her neighbour's massive hedge . Then, 23 years ago, single mother Mrs Alexander bought the house and asked her neighbour Jeanette Robinson to trim the hedge. She claims Mrs Robinson refused and declared: \u2018I would rather move than touch these trees.\u2019 The dispute rumbled on, with Mrs Alexander, 54, claiming that the trees knocked \u00a320,000 off the value of her property. She sensed an opportunity, however, with the passing of the High Hedge Act in Scotland in 2013 which allows local authorities to take action in such cases. Stirling Council has finally ruled that the hedge can stay, despite claims it has knocked \u00a320,000 off the value of neighbour Audrey Alexander's house (pictured) The situation came to a head in 2008, when a 65ft section of hedge is said to have fallen and demolished a neighbour's garden shed . Audrey Alexander (pictured) also claims other neighbours have had to move their children from their bedrooms at night for fear of the falling branches . But her council has ruled that Mrs Robinson can keep the hedge, although it has to be cut to 20ft. Mrs Alexander said the ruling made \u2018no difference\u2019. The High Hedge Act 2013 allows neighbours to complain to the council when a hedgerow blocks sunlight from reaching their garden. Complainants and the hedge's owner are encouraged to resolve the issue between themselves and councils should only be called in to help as a last resort. Because the effect the hedge has is not always clear, disputes can last for years before an agreement can be reached. The local authority can either issue a high hedge notice, which orders owners to cut the hedge back, or decide not to act. The local authority cannot make any orders about the roots of the hedge. She added: \u2018The whole situation is appalling \u2013 the legislation is about giving people the right to sunlight. \u2018It\u2019s a disgrace and I feel extremely let down.\u2019 The neighbour refused to comment. Mrs Alexander\u2019s only option is the courts which she cannot afford to do. Over the years she had used the mediation services of Stirling District Council to try to resolve the issue. The situation came to a head in 2008, when she claims a 65ft section of hedge fell, demolishing a neighbour\u2019s garden shed. Following the introduction of the High Hedge Act, Stirling Council found in her favour but the neighbour appealed and won the 20ft ruling. Dr Colin Watson, of Scothedge, a group which demands the end of \u2018high hedge tyranny\u2019, said that the council\u2019s decision was \u2018pretty crazy\u2019. A council spokesman said the decision was made \u2018after carrying out a site inspection and considering all the evidence\u2019. Mrs Alexander said her aunt, now 87, had moved to France to enjoy \u2018sunshine and gardening\u2019. Ms Alexander called in Stirling District Council to try to solve the quarrel, but no solution could be found and the feud continued . The council ruled that the hedge should be cut to about 20ft, a height which Ms Alexander claims will still block most of her sunlight .",

    "source": "(CNN)The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client \"completely unsubstantiated.\" Appearing Saturday morning on CNN's \"New Day,\" Randy Zelin defended his client, Dr. Anthony Moschetto, who faces criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. \"None of anything in this case has any evidentiary value,\" Zelin told CNN's Christi Paul.  \"It doesn't matter what anyone says, he is presumed to be innocent.\" Moschetto,54, pleaded not guilty to all charges Wednesday.  He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Zelin said that his next move is to get Dr. Moshetto back to work. \"He's got patients to see. This man, while he was in a detention cell, the only thing that he cared about were his patients. And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK,\" Zelin said. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. A requests for comment from an attorney representing Chmela was not returned. It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to \"blow up a building.\" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. \"The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,\" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. \"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,\" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.",

Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.",

Supporters are planning to boycott today\u2019s game at home to Spurs in protest at what they see as a lack of investment and ambition from owner Mike Ashley. Carver was in the dugout alongside Pardew at the end of last season when fans again expressed their discontent during a 3-0 victory over Cardiff. Pardew was booed every time he ventured to the touchline amid a toxic atmosphere inside St James\u2019 Park. Newcastle boss John Carver is under pressure and has asked for advice from some of his predecessors . Alan Pardew was in charge of Newcastle from 2010 to January this year, when he left for Crystal Palace . Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer, the club's record goal-scorer, also had a brief stint as manager . Newcastle fans are planning to protest against owner Mike Ashley for a perceived lack of ambition . Sunday's protests will take place outside of the stadium, but Carver \u2013 who, in fairness, has been left with a depleted and disinterested squad - could nonetheless find himself the target should his side fall to a sixth straight defeat. Carver, though, accepts that he must take criticism and has spoken to the likes of Pardew and close friend Shearer, who was relegated as boss in 2009, for words of encouragement. \u2018Some of the advice I\u2019ve had has been excellent. It\u2019s definitely changed me as a person in how I\u2019ve dealt with things because, in the past, I would have reacted to what people have said and some of the things that have been written,\u2019 he said. \u2018Both Alans have excellent experience at it and that\u2019s why I\u2019m listening to what they are saying. Without a shadow of a doubt they have helped me through this. \u2018We are not through it yet but they have been excellent for me, along with many other people in the game.\u2019 He added: \u2018But the club realise the situation I\u2019m in and they realise that it\u2019s a difficult one, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m convinced they are going to have to invest. \u2018Whether it\u2019s me or whether it's Sir Alex Ferguson doing this job, they would need investment.\u2019 Carver, meanwhile, does not expect a repeat of the poison of 12 months ago when they take on Spurs. \u2018The Cardiff game was one of the strangest atmospheres I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u2019 he said. \u2018We got through it in the end. I hope it won\u2019t be as difficult an atmosphere this time. Toon fans are planning to boycott the next home game with Spurs and have designed anti-Ashley leaflets . Newcastle players are put through their paces in training ahead of the home game with Spurs on Sunday . Newcastle winger Remy Cabella strikes a shot at goal during a training session ahead of the Spurs match . \u2018I don\u2019t think it will be, I think it will be a different type of protest. The fact that people are staying away, the people who come into the stadium will be behind the team because they understand where we are and everyone will be in it together.\u2019 And Carver believes that the home double-header with Spurs and Swansea will determine how the rest of their season plays out. \u2018I think these next two could define the season, because if we don\u2019t pick up results it just adds a bit more pressure,\u2019 he added. \u2018Sometimes pressure can take over and we don\u2019t want to leave ourselves in that situation.\u2019",

The 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles had come under fire during her pregnancy for posting a string of sexy selfies showing off her seemingly rock-hard abs. But James Hunter was born at a healthy eight pounds and seven ounces earlier this week, putting paid to Sarah's critics. Scroll down for video . Underwear model and animal rights activist Sarah Stage shared this adorable picture of her newborn baby James Hunter on Instagram . Sarah Stage took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) on Monday, writing: 'Still waiting'. \u00a0The 30-year-old gave birth James the next day . Sarah shared the adorable pictures to her Instagram page. One, which shows a close up of her son's face, said: 'Love at first sight #jameshunter.' While the first ever picture of James featured the newborn in an adorable fox outfit. Sarah commented on the photo: 'James Hunter (4/14/15) 8.7lbs/22 inches of HEALTHY baby! 'Thank you for the positive support throughout my journey... It's just beginning!!! #JamesHunter #Healthy' During her pregnancy many people commented that they felt Sarah's unusually trim figure could be damaging to her unborn child, but it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah posted this adorable picture of James to her Instagram commenting that it was 'love at first sight' Sarah confirmed her happy news to E!\u00a0revealing that her baby boy was  22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the now mother came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against toned figure their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. In this gorgeous snap James is seen sleeping in a giraffe costume . On Tuesday Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong\u00a0underwear has been liked over40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during the last weeks of her of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' But Sarah didn't just receive harsh comments. Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. Sarah struck various poses for these selfies of herself in her underwear which she posted throughout her pregnancy . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although it has since been proved that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. When she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'",

    "source": "Don McLean (pictured) is responsible American Pie, the lyrics of which have been puzzled over for decades . There has never been a popular song quite like it. For more than 40 years, its lyrics have been an enigma wrapped in an eight-and-a-half minute long rock 'n' roll puzzle. Argued over by generations of geeky fans, deciphered and re-deciphered by code-breaking rock nerds and considered to be poetic reflections on mid-20th century U.S. social history by even groovier academics, it's called American Pie. And this week its lyrics, hand-written in 1971 by a young folk singer called Don McLean, were sold at auction in New York for more than $1 million. That's a lot of money for 18 sheets of paper, albeit with a lost seventh verse. But, to be honest, I rather think that whoever bought them got a bargain. Because, in this age, when song lyrics have all but become meaningless, American Pie illustrates, in a series of images, metaphors and allusions, just what can be done within the frame of a melodically straightforward pop song. It's also a paean to education. McLean loves words, he says, 'almost as much as life'. That may be a slight overstatement, but it shows. Of course, like all poets, McLean didn't give us a key to the riddle of what his song was about when he released his multi-million-selling single. That would have spoiled it. 'It means I'll never have to work again,' he would joke about how much money the song had made him, leaving us to work out for ourselves what the 'sad news on the doorstep' was exactly, and why he 'couldn't take one more step' when he read it. That was the easy part, of course, for anyone of my and his generation who learned about the death in a plane crash in 1959 of one of the first great singer-songwriters of rock, Buddy Holly, when we read about it in the morning newspaper. As McLean sings, it was truly 'The day the music died'. I was on a Ribble bus going to school in Lancashire, peering over the shoulder of the man in front of me when I saw the headline. McLean, according to his song, anyway, was 14 and delivering papers in the rather smart New York suburb of New Rochelle where he grew up. It was a strange, wistful opening for a pop song, but then, as the beat kicked in, the lyrics began to portray the innocence of God-fearing, teenage high school in Fifties America. Listing pop song titles like the Book Of Love and A White Sports Coat and A Pink Carnation, and dances in the gym where the worst that could happen would be that the girl you fancied was dancing with some other guy, it painted a picture of what by 1971 was already a bygone time. Then, in between every verse, would come that cryptic chorus about driving his 'Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry'. For years, I thought that was something to do with the raised earthworks \u2014 levees \u2014 that run along the banks of the Mississippi in New Orleans, until I discovered that a 'levee' can also mean a party. So the parties that kids would attend in the non-threatening Fifties would always have been dry \u2014 that is, without alcohol. Yes, same in Britain. On the surface, it might seem that American Pie \u2014 especially the first half, which was the section mainly played on the radio because the record was far too long to be played in full \u2014 was just a misty-eyed lament for an untroubled Mom and Apple Pie American youth. But, suddenly, the mood changed as McLean \u2014 jaundiced almost, and certainly disappointed \u2014 looked around late-Sixties America and saw how the 'jester in a coat he borrowed from James Dean' (thought to mean Bob Dylan in his leather jacket) stole the King's 'thorny crown'. Or, as you and I might say, knocked Elvis Presley off his top-notch perch. Almost everything is seen through youth icons. In the line 'while Lenin read a book on Marx', was he teasingly criticising John Lennon for appearing to be espousing Marxist revolutionary theory in his solo songs? I think he might have been. And was 'helter skelter in a summer swelter' a reference to the murders of actress Sharon Tate and friends by the 'Charles Manson Family' in Los Angeles in the summer of 1969? It has to be. In an absurd defence, murderer Manson maintained that he had interpreted The Beatles innocuous lyrics in their song Helter Skelter as instructions to go out and kill. Manson is still in jail. Even after all these years, much of American Pie is still opaque. Was the reference to The Byrds' record Eight Miles High a comment on the carpet-bombing by U.S. jets in Vietnam? Only McLean knows \u2014 and he isn't saying. When asked to give a few hints as to the meaning of the lyrics for this week's auction catalogue, he simply said that 'the song was not a parlour game', but 'an indescribable photograph of America that I tried to capture in words and music'. And metaphor, he might have added, as, in my interpretation of the lyrics, a game of American football becomes a student demonstration, probably at Kent State University, over America's military extension of the Vietnam war to Cambodia, to the music of The Beatles' Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album. To this day, songwriter Don McLean has refused to divulge what the lyrics of American Pie refer to . 'The half-time air was sweet-perfume', which probably means that everybody was smoking pot, and wanting to have a nice, quiet time, when the demo was broken up violently by the Ohio National Guard, who shot four students dead. Then there's the question of Mick Jagger. Is he 'Jack be nimble, Jack be quick, Jack Flash sat on a Candlestick'? Maybe. But there is confusion because it isn't The Beatles' famous last U.S. show at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, that McLean is singing about, but The Rolling Stones' performance at nearby Altamont in 1969. At that concert, the Stones performed Sympathy For The Devil and then watched helplessly as, before them in the crowd, Hell's Angels beat a man to death. 'And as I watched him on the stage, my hands were clenched in fists of rage,' go the lyrics of American Pie. 'No angel born in hell, could break that Satan's spell.' Dancing to rock 'n' roll was never meant to get like this, he seems to be saying. I'm not sure that if I were Mick Jagger, I'd want to hear that sung about myself. Although McLean said before the auction of his song's lyrics that the pages would 'divulge everything there is to divulge' about this 'mystical trip into my past', they clearly don't. But the material does cast some light on how the song changed before he recorded it. Originally, he had intended a positive ending, suggesting an extra verse that the music he once loved would be reborn in happier times. But in the end he settled for the more worldly-wise: 'The three men I admire the most, The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost / They caught the last train for the coast / The day the music died.' A bleak ending, yes, but apart from the reference to the Holy Trinity, is there also perhaps a nod here to John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King, whose assassinations occurred in the Sixties? Again, McLean isn't saying. What he does do, however, is give excellent advice to songwriters who are just starting out: 'Immerse yourself in beautiful music and beautiful lyrics and think about every word you say in a song.' Were the lyrics 'The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost' a nod to John F. Kennedy (left), Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King (right), whose assassinations occurred in the Sixties? It seems so obvious, doesn't it? But then you turn on the radio and realise that, with just a few exceptions, an appreciation of good music and lyrics has played little part in the education of so many of today's songwriters. As McLean showed, the right word can mean so much. Most people will probably think of 69-year-old Don McLean as a one-hit wonder \u2014 now living in semi-retirement, and no doubt the lap of luxury, with his wife in Maine. And he certainly wasn't able to ever better American Pie. But at around the same time, he also wrote two other pop classics. Vincent, about Vincent Van Gogh's painting The Starry Night, as well as And I Love You So. This week's buyer of the lyrics of American Pie unfortunately prefers to remain anonymous, and that suggests to me that's he's a billionaire who wants to frame them and stick them on his study wall. I'd far rather they had been bought by an university so students of U.S. literature and social history could spend another 40-odd years poring over them, and discussing what can be done with a popular song, and how America was, as it says in the lyrics, a 'long, long time ago'.",

The binmen in Farnham, Surrey, said the bag of Walkers prawn cocktail crisps fell foul of the rules \u2013 even though it had been dropped there by a litterbug and not by the owner of the bin (file image) Now enraged residents in Farnham, Surrey, have branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter. Homeowners have been told to remove any non-recyclable material from the wheelie bin lids. Dozens of people have now taken to social media to complain that their blue\u00a0wheelie bins have been left full ofwaste by the collection teams which are \u00a0'trying to make a point' over recycling rules. Tracy Porter said on Facebook 'I am so angry about this. 'I live opposite a shop and some kind person, not wanting to litter the\u00a0area, put their crisp packet in the top of my recycling bin, and for that I\u00a0have to be penalised. 'They would not empty the bin. It's not my fault, not even my rubbish. What\u00a0is the place coming to?' Another resident, Peter Smith, said he had been left with a wheelie bin full\u00a0of rotting waste after the collection team refused to empty it because they\u00a0saw a piece of cellophane paper. They ruled the cellophane was not recyclable and broke the rules, but Mr Smith said 'Why not take that little bit off and take the rest? 'They are behaving like little Hitlers.' Waverley Council defended the binmen, saying they had 'nowhere suitable' to put non-recyclable items. The council has suggested placing overflowing recyclable waste in cardboard\u00a0boxes alongside the blue wheelie bins. Enraged residents in Farnham, Surrey, have branded waste collection squads as 'little Hitlers' for enforcing recycling rules to the letter . But resident Teresa Johnstone responded 'We live in England - will they\u00a0bother to pick up rain-sodden boxes which have disintegrated when they can't\u00a0even lift a crisp packet from the bin in the first place? I very much doubt\u00a0it.' A council spokesman said 'To prevent a whole truck of materials ending up in\u00a0landfill, undoing the good work of a majority of residents who are recycling\u00a0correctly, the council enforces the non-collection of contaminated recycling\u00a0bins. 'All collectors working for Waverley's contractor have stickers to place on\u00a0bins which detail why it has not been collected and remind residents what\u00a0should and should not be in the blue bin.' The online discussion was not completely one-sided, with some residents\u00a0posting messages of support for the council's stance and questioning some\u00a0people's commitment to recycling. Zoe Tudor said 'I don't think it's the recycling collectors' job to sort\u00a0through each bin - as if their job isn't hard work enough.'",

The man accused of shooting two police officers during a demonstration in Ferguson has confessed to the crime in a series of phone calls from jail that were recorded. Jeffrey Williams, 20, is accused of shooting and wounding the officers on March 12, during an early-morning rally sparked by the resignation of Ferguson's police chief. All inmates are informed their phone conversations while behind bars are recorded and can be used as evidence against them, but despite the warning Williams spoke freely about the incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center. In a conversation with his girlfriend, Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD on the night of the shooting . 'Nobody aiming at no police,' Williams said. 'I ran up the hill and he (an unidentified person) shot at the car. ... I shot back,' Williams said in the recordings first obtained by KMOV-TV. In another conversation, Williams expressed concern about a possible lengthy prison sentence. 'Even though I was in the wrong, though, I should have just went the other way,' he said. 'Oh man, now I'm looking at 10 years.' Prosecutors say Williams told investigators he fired a gun but was aiming at someone else. Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest. Despite being warned that phone calls from prison can be used as evidence, Jeffrey Williams, 20, spoke freely about the March 12 incident in calls made from the St. Louis County Justice Center . Christmas told The Associated Press on Wednesday morning he hadn't heard the audio of the phone conversations, but he stood by what Williams told him. 'My client has maintained to me that he never fired a gun that night,' Christmas said. 'So until I'm able to see evidence that I can distinctly talk to him about, I have to maintain my commitment to the statements that he has made to me.' Christmas was also critical of the justice center for releasing audio that provides potential evidence against Williams. Ferguson has been a focal point since a white police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was black and unarmed, on Aug. 9. A grand jury in November declined to indict the former officer, Darren Wilson, who also was cleared of civil rights violations by the U.S. Department of Justice in March. Williams said he was being harassed by a group of people outside Ferguson PD and wasn't aiming at the cops. He also expressed remorse . Williams' attorney, Jerryl Christmas, has said Williams told him he never fired during the protest . But a separate DOJ report found widespread racial bias in Ferguson's policing efforts and the municipal court system, which it said was driven by profit mostly extracted from black and low-income residents. Several city officials were fired or resigned following the report. Among those was Police Chief Tom Jackson, and his resignation led several dozen people to protest outside of police headquarters. The demonstration was about to break up when shots rang out. A St. Louis County officer was shot in the shoulder; a Webster Groves officer was hit in the face. Both are expected to fully recover.",

    "source": "(CNN)President Barack Obama took part in a roundtable discussion this week on climate change, refocusing on the issue from a public health vantage point. After the event at Washington's Howard University on Tuesday, Obama sat down with me for a one-on-one interview. I asked him about the science behind climate change and public health and the message he wants the average American to take away, as well as how enforceable his action plan is. Here are five things I learned: . The President enrolled at Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1979 (he transferred to Columbia University his junior year). While in L.A., he said, the air was so bad that it prevented him from running outside. He remembers the air quality alerts and how people with respiratory problems had to stay inside. He credits the Clean Air Act with making Americans \"a lot\" healthier, in addition to being able to \"see the mountains in the background because they aren't covered in smog.\" Obama also said the instances of asthma and other respiratory diseases went down after these measures were taken. Peer-reviewed Environmental Protection Agency studies say that the Clean Air Act and subsequent amendments have reduced early deaths associated with exposure to ambient fine particle pollution and ozone, and reduced illnesses such as chronic bronchitis and acute myocardial infarction. The EPA estimates that, between 1970 and 2010, the act and its amendments prevented 365,000 early deaths from particulate matter alone. \"No challenge poses more of a public threat than climate change,\" the President told me. When I asked about the strength of the science supporting the direct relationship between climate change and public health, he said, \"We know as temperatures rise, insect-borne diseases potentially start shifting up. We know, in a very straight-forward fashion, that heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses and deaths potentially increase, and so what we're doing here is to make sure that in addition to public awareness around the potential for big storms like Hurricane Sandy or big wildfires or droughts, that people recognize there's a very personal, potential impact in climate change, and the good news is we can do something about it.\" In many ways, Obama is attempting to reframe the discussion around climate change as a public health issue that affects all of us, while conceding that we don't fully understand the magnitude of the correlation between rising temperatures and impact on human health. When asked what the average American can do about all this, the President encouraged ordinary citizens, doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials \"to try and make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change.\" He also issued a presidential proclamation declaring April 6-12 as National Public Health Week \"to better understand, communicate and reduce the health impacts of climate change on our communities.\" The average American can also do their part to reduce their own carbon footprint, including: . \u2022 Change your incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent lights. One CFL can reduce up to 1,300 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution during its lifetime. If every house in the U.S. switched its bulbs, we could reduce the electricity spent on lighting by half. \u2022 Unplug your gadgets and chargers when not in use. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this practice can save $100 a year on your energy bill. \u2022 Use a laptop instead of a desktop. Laptops are designed to be energy-efficient, because battery life is a major factor in their design. According to Energy Star, a laptop can be up to 80% more energy-efficient than a desktop. \u2022 Filter your own water. Beyond the environmental toll of plastic waste, consider just how far your water was transported before you bought it at the grocery store. \u2022 Adjust your curtains and thermostats. If you keep your house 2 degrees warmer in the summer and 2 degrees colder in the winter, you can save big bucks on your energy bill. The Department of Energy estimates you can save up to 15% on your bill by turning off your thermostat when you're not at home. Obama did not appear particularly concerned about the current Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act. He  said he believes the statute is \"clear and straightforward.\" He said, \"I am not anticipating the Supreme Court would make such a bad decision.\" At issue is the 32 states that did not set up their own health care exchanges and left it to the federal government to do so. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that the language of the Affordable Care Act does not allow for tax subsidies in those states (without state-based exchanges), possibly creating a situation, for example, in which people in Massachusetts would receive a tax credit, but people living in Texas would not. Obama did tell me that if the Supreme Court challenge is upheld, however, there is no Plan B. \"Millions of people would lose their health insurance. They would no longer be able to afford the health insurance that's being provided out there.\" Obama went on to say, \"I think this is the last gasp of folks who have been fighting against [the Affordable Care Act] for ideological reasons.\" He told me that he \"gets letters every day from people who say, 'you know what, the Affordable Care Act saved my life or saved my kid's life because I got insurance.' 'I thought I was healthy; turns out I had a tumor, but because I went and got a checkup, it was removed in time, and I'm now cancer-free.' \" He added, \"I think stories like that will be factored in when the Supreme Court takes a look at this case.\" CNN's Ben Tinker contributed to this report.",

    "source": "President Barack Obama threw off the gloves and took a direct punch at one of his possible successors, likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker, in an interview airing this morning. Responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office, Obama told NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep that such an approach 'would be foolish.' 'And, you know, perhaps Mr. Walker, after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy, will feel the same way,' the president added. Walker fired back at Obama on Twitter, saying, 'Americans would be better served by a President who spent more time working with governors & Congress rather than attacking them.' Scroll down for video . Foolish: In an interview with NPR, Obama said likely Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker may change his 'foolish' position on a deal with Iran 'after he's taken some time to bone up on foreign policy' Obama's jab at Walker departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term . Obama's jab at Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, departed from the White House's general strategy of staying out of the race to replace the sitting president, who is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking another term. The current administration has been more willing to weigh in, however, when a presumed Republican candidate threatens to dismantle one of the president's prized domestic or foreign policies, which, in the case of Walker, was the nuclear arrangement with Iran. 'I am confident that any president who gets elected will be knowledgeable enough about foreign policy and knowledgeable enough about the traditions and precedents of presidential power that they won't start calling to question the capacity of the executive branch of the United States to enter into agreements with other countries,' Obama told Inskeep during their Monday afternoon chat following the NPR host's invocation of Walker's past comments. 'If that starts being questioned, that's going to be a problem for our friends and that's going to embolden our enemies.' Continuing, Obama said, that 'would be a foolish approach to take' and slammed Walker. A cadre of probable Republican presidential contenders have spoken out against the Obama administration's laboriously negotiated pact with Iran to stunt the growth of the country's program. Walker is the only one to say he would not honor his predecessor's deal with Iran and the international community if elevated to presidency, however. 'If I ultimately choose to run, and if I\u2019m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing \u2014 not just for the region but for this world \u2014 we need is a nuclear-armed Iran,' he told radio host Charlie Sykes last week. 'It leaves not only problems for Israel, because they want to annihilate Israel, it leaves the problems in the sense that the Saudis, the Jordanians and others are gonna want to have access to their own nuclear weapons.' Obama has said on repeat that he believes a diplomatic agreement with Iran that shuts down, in theory, its pathways to developing a bomb will be more effective  than a military option. Obama was responding to Walker's claims that he'd 'absolutely' cancel or 'disown' a deal with Iran on 'day one' if elected to higher office. Walker is currently the governor of Wisconsin . Swatting Walker away: Obama takes part in the White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn, which included a spot of tennis . 'We're now in a position where Iran has agreed to unprecedented inspections and verifications of its program, providing assurances that it is peaceful in nature,' he told NPR, touting the accord that representatives of his administration and five other countries reached with Iran. Furthermore, the global community will have assurances that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranious 'remains in a place where they cannot create a nuclear weapon,' he said. 'This deal is the right thing to do for the United States, for our allies in the region and for world peace.' Obama said 'it's a hard argument to make that we're better off right now' having 'no insight' into Iran's facilities 'and letting them rush towards a bomb.' And if Iran doesn't change its behavior, Obama said the U.S. will 'still have the options available to me - or available to a future president that I have available to me right now.' Included in that portfolio will be the ability to reinstate financial sanctions on the country at any time nuclear experts at the\u00a0International Atomic Energy Agency determine its broken the rules. Other areas of the plan remain fuzzy and will await clarification in a final round of talks, scheduled to take place by the end of June. Already a fissure between the United States' and Iran on sanctions - the U.S. will only commit to gradual relief that can be 'snapped back' into place while Iran is taking the stance that restrictions should be removed immediately and permanently in exchange for nuclear concessions - has emerged since the countries announced the preliminary agreement last Thursday. Obama told NPR his administration still isn't sure it 'can button down' all the issues standing in the way of a long-term agreement and it will have to 'work very hard in order to complete a deal.' And while he characterized Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's demand that a final deal force Iran to recognize his country's right to exist as a 'fundamental misjudgment' of the political waters, Obama noted that one of the most 'profound' differences between America and Iran 'is the vile, anti-Semitic statements that have often come out of the highest levels of the Iranian regime.' 'So what I would say to the Israeli people is you are right to be suspicious of Iran. There's no reason why you should let your guard down with respect to Iran,' he said. 'But ultimately, Iran is deterrable, and it is deterrable not just because of Israel's superior military and intelligence capabilities but also because you got a really strong ally in the United States of America.' Shifting to the topic of Cuba briefly, Obama confirmed that he was considering removing the Latin American country from the U.S.' list of countries that sponsor terrorism. 'Understand that the criteria is very straightforward. Is this particular country considered a state sponsor of terrorism, not, do we agree with them on everything, not whether they engage in repressive or authoritarian activities in their own country,' he said. 'And so those standards, those criteria are the ones that are going to be measured against the current activities of the Cuban government.' Obama said he'll make a decision after he receives the State Department's recommendation. The president said his most pressing concern was whether he could effect the United States' relationship with the communist country in a way that 'benefits the Cuban people over the long term.' 'There are areas where there are serious differences' between the two countries, he said. 'But I do see the possibility -- a great hunger within Cuba -- to begin a change, a process that ultimately, I think, can lead to more freedom and more opportunity.'",

    "source": "An upcoming documentary describes Yelp as the internet's equivalent to the mafia, and the publicly-traded company is doing everything in its power to discredit the film before it is released. Yelp, founded in 2004 by two former PayPal employees, is a website that lets users write their own reviews of businesses like restaurants and doctor's offices. However, like many web businesses, Yelp's revenue comes mainly from advertising and the businesses that buy ads are often also rated and reviewed on the site. Kaylie Milliken is the filmmaker behind Billion Dollar Bully, an ongoing documentary focused on Yelp's impact on small businesses. While she hasn't finished the documentary yet, Milliken tells Daily Mail Online her research so far has indicated Yelp's advertising structure appears to punish businesses that choose not to advertise on the site - a claim that company has vigorously denied. Scroll down for video . A racket? A documentary filmmaker is currently working on a film about Yelp, which she says will unveil shady advertising practices at the company. Above, Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman in August 2014 . Pay to play: Billion Dollar Bully is still in production, but filmmaker Kaylie Milliken says she's already interviewed several small businesses who believe they've been targeted by the company for refusing to advertise . 'Businesses feel extorted,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. 'After they decline advertising services from Yelp they feel like their good reviews get filtered out and their negative reviews come to the front.' And at hundreds of dollars a month for advertising, the price to work with Yelp is too big for many mom and pop businesses, Milliken says. Milliken first started investigating the company a year ago, when she went to see her doctor, who started talking about her negative experiences being listed on Yelp. 'The more she talked about it, the more my jaw just kind of dropped. I knew that they had aggressive salespeople - my husband is a small -business owner and he\u2019s complained before about how pushy they can be. But then she started telling me about receiving reviews, really negative reviews by clients, and she couldn\u2019t figure out who these clients were. 'She was really upset over it. And then she received a review where the client listed ailments about themsel[f] that she had never seen before, and this was the day after she had gotten off the phone with someone from Yelp,' Milliken told International Business Times. Tense: Last month, filmmaker Milliken (right) appeared on CNBC to speak about the movie. Yelp spokeswoman Shannon Eis (left) also appeared on the show to defend the company . Last month, Milliken released a trailer for her documentary in an attempt to fund the rest of the film's production.\u00a0The day after the trailer was released, Yelp stock dipped four per cent. Following the stock drop, Yelp issued a statement to Business Insider, fiercely denying the claims in the\u00a0trailer. 'There is no merit to the claims they appear to highlight, which have been repeatedly dismissed by courts of law, investigated by government regulators, including the FTC, and disproven by academic study,' the company said. On the contrary, Yelp says its algorithm protects businesses, by weeding out potentially fraudulent posts seeking to boost a company's rating or drag it down. As a result, only about 75 per cent of posts are approved for posting on the site while the rest remain in a partially-hidden 'filtered reviews' section on each businesses' page. 'Because businesses have attempted to manipulate their ratings and those of their competitors by trying to post fake reviews, we have to protect consumers and honest businesses by preventing this behavior. As a result, Yelp has automated recommendation software in place to go through the more than 71 million reviews that have been submitted to Yelp to select the most useful and reliable content,' the company said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Yelp's company spokesman Shannon Eis went on\u00a0CNBC to speak out against the documentary in a segment with Milliken, to further illustrate how the company's business practices have been backed by both the courts and independent investigations. However, the Harvard Business School study that the Eis cited in Yelp's defense wasn't solely focused on whether advertising impacts the ratings of businesses listed on the site - rather the investigation was designed to find out how many of the reviews on the site were fake. While the study's authors did find that businesses that advertise on the site are no more likely to have extreme 1 or 5-star ratings than any other business, they made it clear that Yelp's advertising practices were not the topic of their study and therefore their research was not exhaustive. 'While our analysis provides some suggestive evidence against the theory that Yelp favors advertisers, we stress that it is neither exhaustive, nor conclusive. It is beyond the scope of this paper, and outside the capacity of our dataset to evaluate all the ways in which Yelp could favor advertisers,' the paper reads. Standing up: Milliken says that most of the business owners she spoke to were too afraid to appear on camera, for fear of retaliation fro Yelp. Pictured on the left interviewing a business owner, in a photo posted to her production company's website . Work to be done: The Kickstarter campaign to fund Milliken's project reached its $60,000 goal. She plans to resume filming in May and have a rough cut by fall . Milliken says she doesn't place much faith in these cases or investigations, after interviewing several small business owners in the course of her research. 'One company began to advertise with Yelp, but then stopped when their contract came up. The next month they went from five stars to four stars, and then three stars. That story is so common. It happens over and over again and a lot of businesses feel so frustrated at this point,' Milliken told Daily Mail Online. Milliken says that these business owners were so afraid of Yelp that about 80 per cent of them refused to go on camera for fear of retaliation on their own Yelp pages - which they are not allowed to opt out of. In their CNBC talk, Eis also accused Milliken of having a conflict of interest, since she had created several Yelp accounts to write fake reviews of businesses - including her husband's law practice. Milliken admitted to setting up the accounts, but said they were part of her research for the project. 'I think it's shocking and very telling that this billion dollar corporation has come after this grassroots production company - where there are only two of us - creating a documentary that were still in production over...and Yelp has fired back with all that...I think it does clearly show that they are concerned about what will be coming out in the documentary,' Milliken said on CNBC. Daily Mail Online reached out to Yelp for evidence of the allegedly fake reviews Milliken wrote, and the company sent screen grabs that show several accounts tied to the filmmaker and the fact that she commented on her husband's business page. While the 5-star reviews appear to be dated in 2011 (before Milliken says she started working on the documentary), Yelp did not provide copies of the actual reviews. Milliken says she reached out to Yelp for a sit-down interview, but that CEO Jeremy Stoppelman declined. In a statement, the company spokesman explained why they decided to pass on speaking to Milliken. 'Given that the title of the documentary already declares Yelp a bully before production and with a clear disregard for highly credible conclusions, we can be quite certain that our CEO's participation and any objective facts will not be fairly heard. We don't believe Mrs. Milliken is interested in the truth, considering she's shown such a disregard for it so far,' the statement reads. Prost Production's Kickstarter campaign reached its $60,000 funding goal, and Milliken says she will resume filming in May with plans to finish the project in fall so that she can submit it to the Sundance Film Festival.",

An NHS worker who conned a hospital out of more than half a million pounds earmarked for life-saving cancer drugs has been ordered to pay back just \u00a328,737. Stacey Tipler, 33, used her job to steal \u00a3642,000 from the Royal Marsden NHS Trust which she spent on designer shopping sprees, mortgage payments and her planned wedding. But she and partner Scott Chaplin, 34, who was the ringleader of the plot, were caught and both jailed last summer. At Southwark Crown Court today, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said Tipler had made \u00a354,852 from the scheme. At the proceeds of crime hearing, he ordered her to repay \u00a328,737.90 within six months or spend another 18 months in jail. She's already serving four years. Chaplin claimed he 'made nothing' from the scam but was ordered to repay \u00a3115,000 form the the \u00a3310,000 the judge said he made. Judge Leonard said: 'In my judgement it must have been the two people who received the majority of the proceeds of the fraud were this defendant and his Common Law wife Ms Tipler.' For several months after December 2011, she substituted account numbers of pharmaceutical firms who were due payment with the details of men recruited by her partner and the ringleader of the plot, 34-year-old Scott Chaplin. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years after being found guilty of the same offence and one count of conspiracy to money launder. Passing sentence in July last year, Judge Leonard said that while Chaplin from Carshalton in Surrey was the 'main instigator', Tipler was 'invaluable' to the scam, which he said could have been 'catastrophic' for the hospital's patients. He told her: 'It could only have been you who could have come up with the sophisticated and ingenious methods to ensure that your fraud went undetected. 'I am satisfied that it was not you who had the idea to defraud the hospital. It is my judgment that on your own this fraud would not have been committed. 'That said, once the idea was there, the position of trust you held made you invaluable in achieving the fraud. 'The skill which you showed in trying to ensure the fraud would go undiscovered was very great and very dishonest. It was a very clever but dishonest fraud.' The Judge accepted that the crime was hatched by Scott Chaplin, 34, right, but said the position of trust Tipler held was invaluable in the fraud. Pictured outside Southwark Crown Court during trial last summer . Some of the money taken from the hospital was recovered but it was left \u00a3310,000 out of pocket. It was also ordered that part of the money Tipler is to pay back go towards compensating the hospital. The Royal Marsden is a prominent hospital for cancer care, with past patients including the reality TV star Jade Goody and the actress Susannah York. Later Chaplin, dressed in a short-sleeved blue and white striped shirt, stepped into the witness box and insisted he 'didn't make nothing' from the hospital fraud. Judge Leonard said: 'The defendant maintains that he received nothing from the fraud that required his wife to act, as the jury found, to act fraudulently in her role as an accountant for the Royal Marsden Hospital. 'Tipler's defence was that she acted under duress and that was rejected by the jury and indeed I reject it too.' Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist in cancer care. It's one of the places that benefitted from cancer drugs that the funds Tipler stole were intended to pay for. The trust was left \u00a3310,000 out of pocket by the scam . He added that the couple must have seen the majority of the proceeds. Judge Leonard refused to accept his account and ordered him to repay \u00a3115,000 from the \u00a3310,857 he defrauded within six months or face two more years in jail. Money of varying amounts was passed to the accounts of Adrian Horan, 43, Clinton Woollery, 36, Thomas Quinlan, 27, Russell Baker, 33, and William Flynn, 38. Woollery was ordered to repay just \u00a33,062 despite netting \u00a359,525 from the scam. He will face just six weeks in jail if he does not pay the money within four months. Fourth defendant Flynn will return to Southwark Crown Court at a later date for his hearing. Tipler and Chaplin were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and Horan pleaded guilty to the same charge.

    "source": "Gary Locke will be confirmed as Kilmarnock\u2019s permanent manager on Friday - exactly eight weeks after he was asked to take charge until the end of the season. An announcement will be made by the Rugby Park club on Friday morning, with the former Hearts boss being given a three-year deal. And on Thursday the 39-year-old paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour with new chairman Jim Mann since he replaced Allan Johnston on a caretaker basis in February. Kilmarnock will confirm Gary Locke as the club's new permanent manager on Friday . \u2018I\u2019d be over the moon to get it as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve worked hard towards,\u2019 said Locke while negotiations were being finalised at the Ayrshire club. \u2018I had a taste of it (management) at Hearts and really enjoyed it. I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club . He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. \u2018I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. \u2018I\u2019ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. \u2018Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I\u2019ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. \u2018There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.\u2019 Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock \u2014 Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O\u2019Hara \u2014 who will become free agents this summer. \u2018I\u2019ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. \u2018You can\u2019t do that until you are the main man.\u2019",

Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video . Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine . Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades . Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread . As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy . Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event . And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.",

    "source": "Tesla founder Elon Musk has unveiled a 'revolutionary' $3,000 (\u00a31,980) battery which he claims can run an entire home for eight hours. Musk introduced the Powerwall device at a press conference in California last night and said the technology could 'change the world'. The device, which could be in homes by the end of summer, will be able to store electricity at night when it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Tesla has unveiled a $3,000 (\u00a31,980) home battery that can power an entire house for eight hours.\u00a0Powerwall is three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed on an outside or inside wall. The left images shows the 10kWh version while on the right is the 7kWh device . The technology powers up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch the battery on during the day to use the home during the day. Powerwall can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency, or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage.\u00a0The\u00a0 average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. It would then discharge this cheap electricity during the day in quantities large enough to be useful to homes and businesses. The \u00a0Powerwall is around three feet wide and four feet tall, weighs 220lbs, and can be installed either on an outside or inside wall of a home. The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage. Department of Energy\u00a0figures state that the average U.S. home uses 10,908 kilowatt-hours of energy per year, or just short of 30 per day. According to that figure, a single, fully-charged Powerwall device would be able to meet a quarter of a home's energy needs on any given day. However, it would likely last far less time than eight hours during the mornings and evenings, when homes use the vast majority of their electricity. Musk said that the devices can be stacked together to provide more energy. The system would let homeowners with solar panels or other sources of renewable energy easily store their energy at home, rather than the current model whereby they sell power back to energy suppliers as it is produced, then buy it again during peak times. It could also let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper, stored energy during peak periods. According to tech site Mashable, Musk told attendees at the event: 'Our goal is to fundamentally change the way the world uses energy. Pictured is a utility-scale version of Powerwall that can be used by businesses and scaled up for more power . The 'daily use' version has a capacity of 7 kilowatt-hours, which is around a quarter of a home's daily usage . Tesla also unveiled the 'Powerpack', which is the big brother of the Powerwall. It describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that can work for businesses, in industrial applications, and public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh. 'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. 'It sounds crazy, but we want to change the entire energy infrastructure of the world to zero carbon.' As well as the daily-use model, Tesla will also launch a 10 kilowatt-hour backup battery, designed to tide homes over during power blackouts, such as those caused by storms. Marketing material for the device, published late Thursday on Tesla's website, says: 'Powerwall is a home battery that charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening. 'It also fortifies your home against power outages by providing a backup electricity supply. 'Automated, compact and simple to install, Powerwall offers independence from the utility grid and the security of an emergency backup.' Musk said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices, which he touted as a vast improvement over currently-available models. In the past he has said such early batteries 'suck'. He later added that the entire showcase had been powered by a huge array of Powerwall batteries. Pictured is the 'powerpack'. Elon Musk (right) describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH up to 10 MWh and higher . The technology could let savvy consumers take advantage of power companies' lower rates during the night and use the cheaper, stored energy during peak periods. \u00a0Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery is an extension of this . Musk said that he hopes to sell hundreds of millions of the devices, which he touted as a vast improvement over currently-available models. In the past he has said such early batteries 'suck' Tesla also unveiled the 'Powerpack', which is the larger scale version of the Powerwall. It describes it as an 'infinitely scalable system' that can work for businesses, in industrial applications and public utility companies. It comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh. \u00a0'Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale,' it said. The latest announcement builds on previous Tesla products, principally its range of cars. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. These batteries 3ft tall (0.9 metres), and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Tesla would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. Powerwall charges using electricity generated from solar panels, or when utility rates are low, and powers your home in the evening . 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said. Deutsche Bank estimates sales of stationary battery storage systems for homes and commercial uses could yield as much as $4.5 billion in revenue for Tesla. Analysts expect Tesla will build stationary storage systems around the same basic batteries it will produce for its vehicles at a large factory the company is building in Nevada. Stationary storage systems could be part of a fossil-fuel free lifestyle in which an individual has solar panels on the roof, generating electricity that can power home appliances and recharge batteries in a Tesla Model S sedan parked in the garage. Government subsidies and a dramatic drop in the price of lithium ion batteries are drawing more companies into the home electricity storage business. Tesla has so far received $1.1 million from California's Self-Generation Incentive Program. Tesla has received or is poised to receive state funding for about 600 storage projects in California, according to data from the state. Though valued at just $200 million in 2012, the energy storage industry is expected to grow to $19 billion by 2017, according to research firm IHS CERA. In Tesla's view, such storage systems could become part of a fossil-fuel-free lifestyle in which people can have solar panels on their roof generating electricity to power their home and recharge their electric car batteries .",

    "source": "Moscow (CNN)A Russian TV channel aired Hillary Clinton's first campaign video with a rating stamp that means it's for mature audiences, because of fears it might run afoul of the country's anti-gay propaganda law. A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans \"propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors\" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. \"There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't,\" a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. \"Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video).\" Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, \"I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about.\" The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that \"gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\" Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as \"a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia.\" Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. \"I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them,\" Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). \"We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,\" he said before the 2014 Games. \"That's why you can feel safe and free here,\" he added, \"but please leave our children in peace.\" The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

    "source": "Raheem Sterling could force his way out of Liverpool this summer, costing the club up to \u00a325million while saving potential suitors such as Manchester City and Chelsea the same amount. Under Premier League regulations the 20-year-old is entitled to 'buy-out' the last year of  his current contract which runs out in 2017. The effect of that would  see the fee Liverpool could command for the forward dramatically reduce. Raheem Sterling has rejected a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract with Liverpool and could leave this summer . The 20 year-old could lower his value by buying-out the last year of his current deal for \u00a31.7million . Liverpool insist they will hold firm and not be forced into selling Sterling in the close season. However, the Reds would have to reconsider their stance if Sterling and his advisers go down the route of buying out a chunk of his contract. It is understood Liverpool value Sterling as high as \u00a350million given his age, talent and potential. However, if Sterling effectively only had one year left on his contract that fee would be reduced considerably - perhaps even in half to \u00a325 million. With Sterling currently on a \u00a335,000 a week, it would cost the England international \u00a31.7m to buy out the last year of his contract. That sum could swiftly be recouped in the form of a signing on fee with a new club and, of course, in wages. Manchester City and Chelsea are both keen on Sterling, pictured racing against Philippe Coutinho . Sterling's value could plummet by up to \u00a325million is he chooses to buy-out the final year of his contract . Liverpool have remained steadfast that their current offer of \u00a3100,000-a-week, with potential increments, is more than fair. But the player and his advisers believe he is now worthy of earning in the region of \u00a3150,000-a-week. That is the sum the Sterling camp believe they can get elsewhere with clubs they feel are more likely to play Champions League football. Thus far, the stalemate between Sterling and Liverpool does not seem to have affected his performances too much. However, there are those close to the club who feel the situation cannot continue to rumble on for too long for fear of upsetting the mood of the camp. The situation also has the potential to affect Liverpool's moves in the transfer market this summer. Slaven Bilic remains the name that keeps bouncing back from West Ham sources as the most likely to replace Sam Allardyce this summer. Bilic, a  West Ham hero as a player, has an impressive managerial CV having coached Croatia and also has Champions League experience with current club Besiktas. Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic is in the frame to replace Sam Allardyce at West Ham this summer . However, Bilic has not managed in the Premier League and the West Ham hierarchy are nervous about who comes in to take over from Allardyce given how crucial staying in the top-flight is next season with the club moving into the Olympic stadium in 2017. While Swansea's Garry Monk last week dismissed stories linking him to a move to Upton Park, the 36-year-old has been added to West Ham's 'long list' along with Michael Laudrup, Rafa Benitez, Marcelo Bielsa and Frank Rijkaard. Southampton are set to make a move for Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez when the transfer window opens. The Saints believe they could pip West Ham in a move for the Mexican forward, currently on loan at Real Madrid, by offering  Nathaniel Clyne to United for a reduced fee of \u00a320m. Southampton could offer Nathaniel Clyne (right) to Manchester United in order to sign Javier Hernandez (left) Jurgen Klopp's decision to quit Borussia Dortmund caused immediate reports that he could take over at Manchester City or Arsenal this summer. The speculation in each case was not without foundation. Although Manchester City retain the stance they will remain loyal to Manuel Pelligrini, there is bound to be a review of the Chilean's position at the end of what has become a disappointing season. While it would seem Arsenal's revival will see Arsene Wenger remain in the Gunners' hotseat for another season, the sudden and rare availability of a coach with a CV and reputation such as Klopp's could focus minds at the north London club and raise questions about long term planning and an improvement of the clubs Premier League and Champions League challenges. Meanwhile, German club Wolfsburg remain interested in Everton's unsettled striker Romelu Lukaku. Jurgen Klopp could  move to the Premier League after announcing that he will leave Borussia Dortmund . Tottentham could make a move for Aston Villa forward Christian Benteke this summer. Despite the rise of Harry Kane, Spurs still want to bolster their strike force. However, West Ham, with  big ambitions in the build up to their move to Olympic stadium, may take on rivals Spurs in a \u00a320m-plus battle for the Belgium international with the Hammers in the market for a new marksman. Aston Villa's in-form striker Christian Benteke is a summer transfer target for Tottenham and West Ham . I am hearing . Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic has attracted the attention of several clubs given that he has yet to be offered a long term deal by the Hornets. Despite taking Watford to the brink of the Premier League, the 46-year-old Serb - who has revived the club since taking over in October - still has no idea whether he will be given a long-term deal. That will surely be the case should Watford gain promotion. However, if they miss out, Jokanovic could be on the market. There would be plenty of Championship clubs interested and some possible suitors in the Premier League such as Sunderland. Watford boss\u00a0Slavisa Jokanovic is still not sure whether he will be in charge of the Hornets long-term . I am also hearing . West Ham insist they will not be listening to offers for left back Aaron Cresswell. The defender has attracted the attention of several top clubs including Chelsea. However, an offer of \u00a320m could turn their head. The Hammers would then return to Ipswich, having signed Cresswell from the Tractor Boys for \u00a35m last summer, and offer a similar sum for 22-year-old Tyrone Mings. Mings, who replaced Cresswell at left back, is also on Arsenal's radar. West Ham want to keep hold of defender Aaron Cresswell, who is a target for Premier League leaders Chelsea . The Hammers could make a move for Ipswich's Tyrone Mings if they do cash in on Cresswell this summer .",

    "source": "(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream. With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep. Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate \"Gang of 8\" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border. His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters. Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a \"horrifying precedent.\" Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, \"We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.\"  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against \"one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday.\"  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous. He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership. Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of \"Obamacare\" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for \"Obamacare\" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.) Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue. Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico. Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.",

    "source": "The blood of hundreds of baby seals has stained the pristine white snow of Canada's ice floes as the world's largest annual marine mammal slaughter begins. Horrifying images taken only yesterday show seals being shot and wounded before they are dragged onto a vessel - where they clubbed to death for their fur. Photographs of this year's commercial hunt off the coast of Newfoundland were captured by animal rights charity Humane Society International (HSI) who say the baby animals 'are dying a violent death for fur products that nobody is buying'. Horrific: Humane Society International has captured shocking images of seals being clubbed to death on Canada's ice floes (pictured) as this year's 'commercial hunt' gets underway . Cruel: Images show the animals - who are eventually skinned for their fur - being shot and wounded on the thin ice before being dragged (pictured) onto vessels . Chilling: The seals who do not die from the gunshot wounds are dragged onto ships (pictured) where they are clubbed to death . Gruesome: The baby animals (pictured) are suffering a violent death 'for fur products nobody wants' according to Humane Society International . Inhumane: Some seals die from the gunshot wounds (top) while others escape into the water where they slowly die from their injuries (bottom) Blood-stained: Once the animals are shot, sealers retrieve the bodies by impaling them with a sharpened hook (pictured) which forces the seals that are still alive to violently thrash out . Cruel: The images HSI took from a helicopter above Newfoundland's ice floes show sealers (pictured) pulling the seal's blood-stained carcasses onto their ship . The disturbing images show the animals thrashing in pain as they are pulled across the blood-stained snow while others are seen impaled on the boat's deck. HSI's executive director Rebecca Aldworth said: 'This is the 17th year that I have witnessed the seal slaughter. The suffering I have seen is impossible to forget.\u00a0If the killing happened in view of the public, it would have been shut down decades ago. But it occurs far offshore. 'We saw one baby seal clearly raise her head from the massive pool of blood she lay in. Another was shot and thrashed on the ice only to slip into the blood-slicked water. 'It is reprehensible that these baby seals are being killed with government financing, even as the largest seal processor in Canada admits to warehousing a stockpile of seal fur.' The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 harp, hooded and grey seals, according to HSI.\u00a0They claim the seals - many of which are just a few weeks old - are shot, clubbed and skinned for their fur despite a decreasing global demand for them. Killing: Even Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt (pictured) Unforgiving: The animals are slaughtered in a remote region off the coast of Newfoundland (pictured) - HSI says if the killing happened in view of the public 'it would have been shut down decades ago' Brutal: Veterinary experts claim the seals are killed inhumanely in the commercial hunt (pictured) because of the harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which they are killed . Barbaric: HSI's executive director says 'it is reprehensible that these baby seals (pictured) are being killed with government financing' Demand: The country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase the fur from seals who are killed and skinned (pictured) during commercial hunts . Innocent: Government reports found 98 percent of the seals (pictured) killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are less than three months of age, according to HSI . The demand for seal products diminished greatly after the European Union, United States, Switzerland, Mexico, Taiwan and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia banned the trade of some or all products of commercial seal hunts. With China also blocking attempts to import seal meat into the country, the price of seal products from Canada declined rapidly and convinced many 'sealers' to abandon the act. Sir Paul McCartney who visited a seal nursery with HSI in 2006 has made an emotional plea for Canada to stop the seal hunt. The former Beatle said: 'Canada's brutal commercial seal hunt has begun, and once again thousands of baby seals will be shot and bludgeoned to make fur products that nobody wants or needs. 'Videos of the bloody seal slaughter provide the only vital evidence to demonstrate year after year that these seals are dying a horrible death for their fur.' In recent years, Newfoundland's government has reportedly dished out \u00a36million in subsidies to seal processing plants to 'prop up the dying industry' - and announced a further \u00a31.3million earlier this month. 'It is a double tragedy,' according to HSI spokesperson Wendy Higgins who told MailOnline: 'They [seals] are suffering for frivolous fur products and Canada can't even sell the fur because more and more countries around the world are boycotting sales because of the horrendous cruelty.' 'We want the Canadian government to offer a buy-out to the sealers and put and end to this senseless slaughter. 'The hunt is legal but that doesn't mean that the killing is always done according to what few guidelines govern the industry and HSI has frequently documented breaches. 'Even if they did always kill the seals according to the rules, it's still a dreadfully brutal process... This hunt is taking place many hundreds of miles out with absolutely no-one there to monitor what they're doing.' Immoral: Even though the hunt (pictured) is legal in Canada, animal rights campaigners say\u00a0it's still a dreadfully brutal process . Shocking: The Newfoundland government has authorised the killing of up to 468,000 seals (pictured) this year, despite declining global demand for their fur . Hunted: The boss of a company who accepted government funds to continue purchasing sealskin said 'it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry' Death: As many as half-a-million seals (pictured) will be hunted and killed in this year's cull . Only this week the country's largest purchaser of sealskin announced that it will no longer purchase seal fur, citing a lack of demand and a warehouse full of it. Carino Processing Ltd\u00a0also refused over \u00a3600,000 in financing from the Newfoundland government. But a new company PhocaLux International\u00a0is accepting government funds and has stated it will purchase around 30,000 seal furs, according to CBC. The firm's Chief Executive told the news channel 'the markets aren't really great around the world... it's probably not a really good time to get in this industry.' Government reports confirmed that 98 percent of the seals killed in the Canadian commercial seal slaughter are pups less than three months of age, according to HSI. Veterinary experts have stated that Canada's commercial seal hunt is inherently inhumane because of the remote, harsh environment in which it occurs and the speed at which the killing is conducted for commercial and safety reasons.",

Filmed at the Orana Wildlife Park \u2013 the country\u2019s only open-range zoo \u2013 the video shows the lions interacting with the visitors who stand inside a metal cage attached to a car. The video, which was captured by Ekant Veer, 35, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury, also shows the lions scaling the cage and eating meat through its bars. The lions at Orana Wildlife Park approach the metal cage and begin interacting with the people inside . Standing with its paws against the cage, a lion is introduced as Sakura who is around 11-years-old and weighs about 265kg. As the keeper speaks, the lion licks at a piece of meat that is held up against the bars as another lion walks across the roof of the cage. Looking down at the people below, the lion wanders around as if deciding who it would like to make its prey before staring down the lens of the camera. Set tongues wagging! One of the lions notices meat and begins sticking out its tongue in the hope of being fed . A lion stands next to one of the keepers and its large paw is the same size as the lady's head . The people inside can be seen recording the many lions from their phones, while another \u2013 with paws the same size as the keeper\u2019s head \u2013 holds itself up against the cage and chews on some meat. Later in the video people can be seen pointing out the various felines as a keeper moves her hand along the cage, instigating the lion to follow. Still frames capture a lion standing up against the side of the cage alongside the keeper \u2013 its power and size is plain to see. A keeper holds a piece of meat up to the bars of the cage and a lion follows her hand in the hope of receiving it . A number of lions are fed directly through the metal bars, while others receive meat dropped from the back of the cage . The car then begins driving away and the lions can be seen chasing after the people in the hope of receiving more food. A keeper then drops meat from the back of it and the lions begin tailing off one by one with their own little piece of food. The video concludes with one lion picking up a final lump of meat from the floor and being chased by another, angry feline. A lion scales the cage and looks down at the people below as if deciding which one it would like to eat . The people inside can be seen pointing and filming the lion who wanders along the top of the cage above them . Orana Wildlife Park was opened in 1976 and is owned and operated by registered charity, Orana Wildlife Trust. Located on the outskirts of Christchurch, the wildlife park is unique in that the people are caged in order to view the animals, not the other way around.",

Having beaten Denmark and Azerbaijan in their opening Elite Round qualifiers, the Young Lions had to beat France in Saint-Lo to advance to July's finals in Greece . But goals from Sehrou Guirassy and Gnaly Cornet put the hosts in command and a late response from Fulham's Patrick Roberts wasn't enough to rescue Sean O'Driscoll's team. Patrick Roberts was on target for England's Young Lions against France but it wasn't enough to qualify . Boosted by the return of Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Harry Winks from suspension, O'Driscoll reverted to the line-up that had beaten Denmark 3-2 late last week. A swirling wind in Normandy made playing conditions difficult, with any long balls ineffective, and consequently the first period saw very few chances. France managed to take one of theirs, however, just after the half-hour mark. Neal Maupay fired the ball into a crowded penalty area and Guirassy had the presence of mind to divert it past England goalkeeper Angus Gunn. Chelsea' Izzy Brown came close to equalising shortly before half-time but sent Demarai Gray's cross over the bar inside the six-yard box. Sean O'Driscoll's team have missed out on this summer's European Championship finals in Greece . France's second goal, five minutes into the second half, left England with a mountain to climb. Maupay again provided the assist, passing to Cornet to drill the ball in off the near post. The home side were almost over the finish line but there was a flicker of hope for England when Roberts halved the deficit from a Ruben Loftus-Cheek cross 11 minutes from time. But England required a further two goals because of their inferior goal difference in the group and there was to be no late drama as their Euro ambitions faded. England (4-1-4-1): Angus Gunn (Manchester City); Ashley Smith-Brown (Manchester City), Joe Gomez (Charlton Athletic), Brendan Galloway (Everton), Ben Chilwell (Leicester City); Harry Winks (Tottenham Hotspur); Patrick Roberts (Fulham), Ruben Loftus-Cheek (Chelsea), Charlie Colkett (Chelsea), Demarai Gray (Birmingham City); Izzy Brown (C; Chelsea).

    "source": "With the Premier League season entering its final stretch, focus is now turning to the summer transfer window. Many clubs will be looking to snap up a bargain free transfer and there are plenty to choose from. Here are best players who are currently set to leave their Premier League clubs on a free in June. Manchester City's tenacious, \u00a0creative and versatile midfielder James Milner could leave as a free agent . Goalkeeper - Gerhard Tremmel (Swansea) At 36 years old, he is no spring chicken, but Tremmel could prove a useful acquisition for a newly-promoted side. Tremmel has played second fiddle to Michel Vorm and then Lukasz Fabianski during his four years at Swansea, but has performed well when called upon in the cup competitions and was in goal when the Swans beat Bradford in the Capital One Cup final two years ago. Swansea's Gerhard Tremmel, 36, is the understudy for Lukasz Fabianski but has done well in the cups . Right-back - Glen Johnson (Liverpool) England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup is still a regular for Liverpool, but he looks almost certain to end his six-year spell at Anfield this summer. Johnson, who has 54 England caps, is on a bumper deal at the Merseyside club and there seems to be little appetite to keep him on the books. England's first-choice right-back at the World Cup looks set to leave Liverpool after six years this summer . Centre-back - Kolo Toure (Liverpool) Another regular at Liverpool who is still to extend his contract. Toure kept Cristiano Ronaldo quiet with an excellent display when Real Madrid came to Anfield in November, but the 34-year-old Ivorian lacks consistency and has made some terrible gaffes in his time at the club. Inconsistency has been Kolo Toure's curse - the 34-year-old Ivorian has produced some howlers at Liverpool . Centre-back - Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Vlaar performed so well at the World Cup that his omission from the team of the tournament raised a few eyebrows, especially when Thiago Silva was selected ahead of him. Injury has restricted the Dutchman to 16 appearances for Villa this season. At 30, he has at least a couple of years left in him yet and will surely be courted by other top-flight teams. Holland's Ron Vlaar was a surprise omission from the team of the World Cup but could leave Aston Villa . Left-back - Luke Garbutt (Everton) Everton have been doing everything they can to tie this promising young defender down to a new deal, but he is yet to put pen to paper. The 21-year-old has played nine times for Everton this year and faces a big battle to displace Leighton Baines so he may fancy a challenge elsewhere. Everton want to lock the talented 21-year-old Luke Garbutt down for the long term but he's yet to commit . Right wing - James Milner (Manchester City) Probably the most high-profile free agent available this summer, Milner has 15 years' worth of top-flight experience to his name and 53 England caps. Milner is both tenacious and creative, either in the centre of midfield or out wide, and he is still a year off his 30th birthday. Milner has 15 years in top flight experience, 53 England caps and still isn't 30, so a great buy for someone . Central midfield - Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Named Arsenal captain last summer, but Arteta has not played for the Gunners since November due to injury. Hard to see him displacing the in-form Francis Coquelin on his return. May be 33, but still has a good eye for a pass and is also a free-kick specialist. Mikel Arteta hasn't played for Arsenal since November due to injury and will need to displace Francis Coquelin . Central midfield - Tom Cleverley (Manchester United) Named captain for a tour match against Roma last summer, Cleverley clearly thought he had a future under new United manager Louis van Gaal. 'I think I'm going to be his type of player,' he said. But alas, that did not prove to be the case. The 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to Aston Villa, where he has played 30 times. He is not wanted back at United. Villa and Everton are keen to sign the England international. Unwanted by Manchester United, Aston Villa and Everton want to sign England international Tom Cleverley . Left wing - Jonas Gutierrez (Newcastle) Bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the Newcastle squad last month, but is no longer wanted by his club. Will be 32 in the summer, but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him. Testicular cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere, even if it isn't Newcastle . Striker - Danny Ings (Burnley) One of a number of young English strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for Burnley this season. Rumoured to be of interest to Manchester United and their neighbours City, as well as David Moyes' Real Sociedad. Manchester United and City are said to be interested in Burnley's dangerous striker Danny Ings . Striker - James Wilson (Manchester United) Promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under Ryan Giggs against Hull. The 19-year-old has played 16 times under Van Gaal, but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close, the United academy product is yet to agree terms. James Wilson, 19, has played 16 times under Louis van Gaal but is now struggling to get on the bench .",

The first president to visit Jamaica in three decades, Obama arrived in Kingston yesterday evening and was met by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller, U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica Luis Moreno and a dozen other dignitaries. Obama promptly embraced the local color  by making an unscheduled late night visit to the museum dedicated to the island's most famous son. Scroll down for video . Barack Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Bob Marley museum while on an official visit to Jamaica . The U.S. President walks around the museum with tour guide Natasha Clark during his unannounced visit . On a tour of the house where the reggae legend lived until his death in 1981, Obama, looking relaxed in shirtsleeves, was shown a trophy room where Marley's Grammys and platinum records were on display. At the same time Marley's hit song 'One Love' played over the loudspeaker. The musician's family transformed the rambling property into a museum complete with a well-equipped 80-seat theatre, a photographic gallery, and a gift shop selling T-shirts, posters and CDs and other Bob Marley memorabilia. One of the rooms Obama explored held the late reggae star's platinum records and a Grammy award. Thee president looks at selection of Bob Marley's gold records at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston . The building was home to Marley until his death in 1981 and was converted into a museum by his family . 'What a wonderful tour,' the president told museum guide Natasha Clark. 'I still have all the albums.' Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc. The visit is part of an official Caribbean summit seeking to reassert U.S. leadership in the region at a time when oil-producing Venezuela's economic clout may be receding. The Caribbean region collectively cheered when Obama was first elected president in 2008. Calypso and reggae songs were written in his honor, the French Caribbean island of Martinique named a road after him, and Antigua's highest mountain officially became 'Mount Obama' as the small country saluted him as a symbol of black achievement. Obama thanked the guide for a wonderful tour and told her he still owns all of Bob Marley's albums . Obama is in Jamaica to meet the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc to discuss energy and security . As the first U.S. president to visit Kingston since Ronald Reagan in 1982, Obama faces the challenge of convincing Caribbean island leaders that Washington is genuinely re-engaging after a long period of perceived neglect of its smaller, poorer neighbors. The visit is expected to be dominated by discussions on energy, security and trade with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom. Some analysts say a key reason why Washington is suddenly paying attention to the Caribbean Basin is that it wants to wean the islands off dependence on cut-rate Venezuelan oil that Caracas has long used to wield influence in the region. From Jamaica, Obama will travel to Panama to attend a Western Hemisphere summit, where Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has made clear he will confront Obama over new U.S. sanctions. Obama will also cross paths at the Summit of the Americas with Cuban President Raul Castro for the first time since the two announced a historic opening between their countries in December.",

    "source": "British police helped Australian officials foil a suspected Lee Rigby-style terror attack on police during First World War commemorations, it emerged today. A\u00a014-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

She had spent four hours earlier that afternoon bleaching her teeth and, as far as she was concerned, the considerable discomfort was worth it. \u2018Whitening has been unbearably painful at times,\u2019 says Teresa, 40. \u2018But I am obsessive about having a bright smile.\u2019 Teresa\u2019s regimen may sound somewhat masochistic, but she is one of an increasing number of women for whom whitening their teeth has become an integral part of their beauty routine \u2014 as normal as colouring their hair or waxing their legs. In America, sales of tooth whitening products have risen 300 per cent since 1996, and the trend for excessive bleaching has grown so commonplace there that dentists have coined a new word for it \u2014 \u2018bleachorexia\u2019. Symptoms include burning gums, tooth infection and the conviction that, no matter how much a tooth has been whitened, it could be paler still. Perhaps predictably, it has caught on in Britain. Almost a third of Britons are now preoccupied with whitening their teeth, and research this week revealed the highest-earning cosmetic dentists made a collective turnover of \u00a31 billion last year \u2014 a 22 per cent increase from 2010. \u2018When it is done properly, tooth whitening is a simple and safe way of improving your appearance,\u2019 says cosmetic dentist Dr Mervyn Druian. \u2018But if it is performed in an unregulated fashion, with the wrong product, it can cause enamel erosion, receding gums and infection.\u2019 Tessa (pictured) is part of a growing group of women for whom teeth whitening has become an integral part of their beauty regime . Teresa, a banking finance officer from London, started whitening her teeth five years ago, influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired. \u2018My own teeth looked grey in comparison after years of caffeinated drinks and they were affecting my confidence,\u2019 she says. The active ingredient in most professional whitening products is hydrogen peroxide, in gel form. In October 2012, an EU council directive made it illegal in Britain to use hydrogen peroxide \u2014 which can cause sensitivity and burning when applied too often or at too high a dose \u2014 in concentrations above 6 per cent, and decreed any concentration over 0.1 per cent could be administered only by a dental professional. When carrying out the procedure, a dentist makes a mould of the patient\u2019s teeth from which a special tray is constructed. Hydrogen peroxide gel is then squirted on to the tray via a syringe, and the tray fitted over the teeth and left for 45 minutes. Teresa (pictured) started whitening her teeth five years ago having been influenced by the brilliant smiles of celebrities she admired . Usually, the first treatment is carried out at the surgery, then the patient is given syringes and the tray to use at home \u2014 45 minutes a day, for a fortnight, being the norm. The treatment normally costs up to \u00a3500, so when Teresa spotted a DIY whitening kit online for \u00a317.99, she was tempted. It looked authentic enough: a silicone tray and five syringes of bleach. Teresa isn\u2019t sure how strong this hydrogen peroxide was, or indeed even if it was hydrogen peroxide. But the tray had to be moulded to her teeth \u2014 by softening in boiling water first \u2014 then worn overnight. That\u2019s when the warning bells should have sounded, says Dr Druian: \u2018Trays should always be properly fitted by a dentist otherwise they will never fit well and can cause leakage, which irritates gums.\u2019 Lisa Arbiter (pictured)\u00a0has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years . Sure enough, the minute Teresa put the tray on, her gums started to tingle. \u2018I just assumed it meant it was working,\u2019 she says. Keen to go whiter than white, she kept the bleach on for an hour \u2014 another mistake, says Dr Druian. \u2018After 45 minutes out of the syringe, hydrogen peroxide loses effectiveness. More time won\u2019t make your teeth whiter, it will just lead to irritation and sensitivity. And if you have decay in your teeth, it can enter and lead to infection.\u2019 But Teresa was so delighted with the initial results that she used her whitening kit once a week, leaving it on for longer each time. By the time she had reached her last syringe, she was bleaching for up to four hours at a time. Lisa (pictured) was just 19 when she first tried bleaching her teeth, she now says it's addictive and she'll carry on doing it for ever . \u2018My teeth were so weak and sensitive I worried they were going to fall out. I was in agony. I knew I was being irrational, but having white teeth had become a part of my identity. It was only after an evening of not being able to eat and waiting for days for my swollen gums to go down that I realised I\u2019d gone too far.\u2019 So Teresa invested in whitening toothpastes, a whitening powder and a whitening pen instead. Ironically, the changes made to the law in 2012, which were supposed to protect patients\u2019 dental health, have seen a flood of illegal DIY whitening products on to the market, alongside unqualified practitioners who cater for those \u2014 like Teresa \u2014 who can\u2019t afford a dentist\u2019s whitening service. \u2018There has been an upsurge in beauticians whitening teeth with unregulated materials,\u2019 says Dr Druian. \u2018Many use chlorine dioxide \u2014 a strong antibacterial chemical sometimes found in swimming pools \u2014 which is easier to get hold of, given the Government\u2019s restrictions on hydrogen peroxide. Lisa (pictured)\u00a0buys \u00a350 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S and insists she has no pain or side effects from the treatment . \u2018At a high concentration, this can burn gums, leading to receding, and make tooth enamel rough and porous, which leaves it prone to further staining \u2014 trapping users into a vicious cycle of whitening.\u2019 Natasha Crane, from Norwich, is suffering from suspected enamel erosion after having her teeth whitened, for \u00a330, by a beautician operating illegally. She had seen an advert on Facebook. Unknown to Natasha, aged 17, she is a year under the legal age limit for teeth whitening, but the beautician didn\u2019t check. \u2018She painted the whitening gel on with cotton wool,\u2019 remembers Natasha. \u2018It didn\u2019t feel professional or hygienic, but this was my first experience of tooth whitening.\u2019 As soon as the beautician removed the gel an hour later, and Natasha rinsed her mouth, her teeth felt agonisingly sensitive. Newlywed Donna Bilson (pictured) is a recent convert to tooth bleaching but is already very taken with it . \u2018The beautician said this was normal,\u2019 she recalls. \u2018When the pain didn\u2019t go away over the next few days I called her back, but she still said there was nothing to worry about.\u2019 After later discovering that her beautician had been operating illegally, she reported her to the General Dental Council \u2014 the regulatory body for British dentists. Since then, Natasha\u2019s teeth have grown more painful. \u2018They\u2019re so sensitive that it hurts when they come into contact with fresh air,\u2019 she says. \u2018I have to wear a scarf over my mouth outdoors. Eating is agony and I drink through a straw.\u2019 Meanwhile, her teeth are starting to turn yellow because the dentine that is underneath the enamel is becoming exposed. \u2018Not only am I in pain, but, ironically, my teeth have never looked worse,\u2019 says Natasha. Beauticians practising illegally are not the only problem, however. Increasing numbers of women are ordering industrial-strength hydrogen-peroxide whitening products online from the U.S., where there are no legal limits on levels. Donna (pictured) and her husband, Andy, both started bleaching their teeth before they got married last October . Lisa Arbiter, 33, has been bulk-buying high-strength bleach from America to whiten her teeth every month for the past 13 years. She was 19 and working as a beauty therapist when she first tried it. She buys \u00a350 boxes of syringes of a 25 per cent solution from the U.S., yet insists she has no side-effects other than sensitive teeth. \u2018At work, having white teeth makes me look more professional,\u2019 she says. \u2018And having so many pictures of ourselves plastered on social media makes it obvious who has whitened their teeth and who hasn\u2019t. Un-whitened teeth look dirty. \u2018Tooth whitening is addictive, and I\u2019ll carry on bleaching mine for ever.\u2019 According to the British Dental Health Foundation the effects of professional whitening can last for up to three years. Although her husband stopped after their wedding, Donna (pictured) has carried on and says its part of her beauty routine now . But newlywed Donna Billson \u2014 a recent convert to tooth bleaching \u2014 is already hooked on doing it far more frequently than that. Donna and her husband Andy, 34, started whitening their teeth last January in the run-up to their wedding last October. \u2018We wanted to look our best in the pictures,\u2019 says Donna, 36, a HR manager from Birmingham. They ordered \u00a355 boxes of 20 whitening strips \u2014 fabrics impregnated with 6 per cent hydrogen peroxide gel that users stick to their teeth for 45 minutes \u2014 from the States. \u2018Andy stopped after our wedding and says I don\u2019t need to whiten my teeth any more either,\u2019 says Donna. \u2018But I\u2019ll carry on. It\u2019s as much a part of my beauty routine as having my hair coloured and legs waxed.\u2019",

The kickoff to the new season leads the list of six things to watch in the week ahead. 1. \"Orphan Black,\" 9 p.m. ET, Saturday, April 18, BBC America . The cloning cult sci-fi series remains one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, thanks in large part to the performance of Tatiana Maslany, who has taken on at least six roles on the show so far, including a newly introduced transgender clone. Maslany told reporters this week that we can expect even more impressive scenes with multiple clones. \"We like to push the boundaries of what we're able to do and the limits of those clone scenes,\" she said. \"So, yes, you'll definitely see more complex clone work this season and that's just because we're getting more comfortable with the technology and we're excited by getting to sort of further complicate things.\" And the introduction of a group of male clones will certainly increase the suspense. \"There definitely is a shift towards the Castor clones that we get to explore them a little bit more,\" she said. The fans of the show, dubbed the \"Clone Club\" have a lot to look forward to when the show premieres on Saturday the 18th, and Maslany is blown away by the response to the series so far. \"We've always been really humbled and really inspired by our fans and by their dedication to the show and their knowledge of the show, and  just how it changes their own lives. It's incredible.\" 2. \"Turn: Washington's Spies,\" 9 p.m. ET, Monday, AMC . The series about spies in the early days of the Revolutionary War returns with a new subtitle, \"Washington's Spies,\" and a new Monday night time slot. Series star Jamie Bell told CNN what we can expect in the second season. \"This year we have a lot more battles; we have the journey of [George] Washington and we're getting under his skin a little bit as well. We also introduce new characters like Benedict Arnold, a very infamous character in American history.\" Bell hopes the series might bring more recognition to the Culper spy ring and everything it did. \"I think there should be a monument to all of the Culper ring somewhere. I was amazed that there is nothing [in Washington] about these people who did something extraordinary.\" 3. \"Game of Thrones,\" 9 p.m. ET, Sunday, HBO . The world of Westeros returns for a fifth season in one of the biggest season premieres of the year. Click here for more on what to expect. 4. \"Justified,\" 10 p.m. ET, Tuesday, FX . Timothy Olyphant's tour de force performance as Raylan Givens comes to an end Tuesday night, as the modern-day Western airs its season finale. We'll have to see how his final showdown with Boyd Crowder goes. 5. \"Veep,\" 10:30 ET, Sunday, HBO . Hugh Laurie joins the cast and Julia Louis-Dreyfus is now the president of the United States on HBO's hit comedy. 6. \"Nurse Jackie,\" 9 p.m. ET, Sunday, Showtime .

Caller:  \"Hello, I'm trapped in this plane and I called my job, but I'm in this plane.\" Operator:  \"You're where?\" Caller:  \"I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's up moving in the air.  Flight 448 can you please tell somebody (to) stop it.\" The frantic 911 call came just as the Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon.  The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold. The cell phone call soon broke up, but the man was making himself known in other ways as the crew and passengers reported unusual banging from the belly of the Boeing 737. The pilot radioed air traffic control and said he would make an emergency landing. \"There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,\" he told air traffic control. The ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage. He'll no longer have the option of dozing aboard one of the airline's planes. \"The Menzies employee has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines planes,\" said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for the airline. Flight 448, which was on its way to Los Angeles, only spent 14 minutes in the air. Other than being scared, the agent never was in any real danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. \"All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,\" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. Not everyone heard the banging, but it was soon clear this wasn't a normal flight. \"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,\" passenger Marty Collins told affiliate KOMO. \"When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.\" \"I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,\" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. \"Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?\" The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. The agent was off the two days prior to the incident and had taken a lunch break and a break in the afternoon before making his way into the cargo hold, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. \"During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,\" the airline's blog said. It's believed he was hidden by luggage, making it difficult for the rest of his team to see him, the source said. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles a couple of hours late. CNN's Dave Alsup, Joshua Gaynor and Greg Morrison contributed to this report.",

    "source": "Taxpayers are having to find \u00a311billion a year to top up the wages of millions of people working in supermarkets and other low paid jobs. The money, which amounts to a massive public subsidy for the companies involved, is paid to some 5.2million workers in the form of tax credits and other benefits. Campaigners say the figures shine a light on how companies making huge profits are relying on the taxpayer to ensure their staff have enough money to put food on the table. The total amount of benefits paid to staff at some companies exceeds what the firms pay in corporation tax, according to the study by Citizens UK. Critics have accused supermarkets of relying on benefits to ensure their staff earn enough to put food on the table without them having to raise wages . The charity is campaigning for the adoption of the Living Wage - \u00a39.15 an hour in London and \u00a37.85 for the rest of the UK - across both the public and private sector. It estimates this would reduce the need for in-work benefits by \u00a36.7bn a year, which would make a massive dent in the \u00a312billion reduction in welfare spending which the Conservatives say is necessary. The current minimum wage for those over 21 is \u00a36.50 an hour and will rise to \u00a36.70 in October, but this is well below what the Government accepts is needed by many people, particularly those with children, to make ends meet. The charity\u2019s report complains: \u2018The public subsidy enables profitable businesses to get away with paying low wages.\u2019 Its report says Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury\u2019s posted combined profits of \u00a33.9bn last year, but between them cost the taxpayer more than \u00a3750m in benefits paid to their staff. Tesco paid \u00a3519m in tax but received \u00a3364m in public subsidy for its 209,000 low-paid workers. Asda spent \u00a3150m in tax but its 120,000 low-paid workers received \u00a3221m in benefits. Morrisons\u2019 tax bill was \u00a362m while its 83,000 low-paid workers received \u00a3190m in benefits and Sainsbury\u2019s paid \u00a3180m in tax, almost exactly as much as its low-paid staff received from the public purse. Of all the profitable companies examined by the charity, Next had the highest average subsidy of \u00a32,087 per head given its high proportion of young employees who are typically paid just above the minimum wage of \u00a36.70 an hour. Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an \u2018invention\u2019 Next is run by the Conservative peer, Lord Wolfson, who came under fire last month for criticising the whole idea of a Living Wage as an \u2018invention\u2019. He argued that pushing up wages will block recruitment. \u2018For very many people, the retail sector provides useful income and Next has 30 applications for every vacancy. Raising wages too fast will simply reduce employment opportunities,\u2019 he said. Other firms who rely on the taxpayer to top up staff wages include Amazon, fast food outlets and local authorities, where cleaning and care workers, for example, are already paid by the taxpayer. Paul Regan, chairman of Citizens UK, said: \u2018The major retailers post profits and pay tax, but the Treasury has to step in and often pays out more than it gets in to help those workers for whom work does not pay.\u2019 He called on the next government to show leadership \u2018by implementing the living wage into all public sector commissioning\u2019. The Rev Karen Rooms, Area Dean for Nottingham South and member of the Citizens UK Council, said: \u2018The figures revealed by this research are shocking, as the true scale of the subsidy of big business becomes clear. \u2018The huge profits made by some of these high street names are made off the back of poverty-wages. In some instances the amount of tax they pay doesn\u2019t even cover the wage top-ups we all have to chip-in and help with through the Treasury. \u2018At a time of austerity when all sectors of society have to make savings it seems obscene that big business isn\u2019t playing its part to help the country recover.\u2019 All of the main political parties support the living wage. Last week, David Cameron said businesses that can afford to pay it \u2018should consider doing so\u2019. Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said it was \u2018madness\u2019 that large employers paid chief executives huge salaries while their lowest-paid workers were subsidised by the taxpayer. Labour has made demands for employers to pay the Living Wage a major plank of its election strategy. However, the former Labour Cabinet minister Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said it could take 10 years to make the living wage a reality. He said: \u2018Employers will have to pay more but wages cannot rise without improved productivity and more skills training. We will need a 10-year transition period to become a living wage country.\u2019 Charles Cotton, of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned wage rises will hit employment, saying: \u2018If employees weren\u2019t getting subsidies, would firms employ as many people or would they cut back?\u2019 Supermarkets said they paid above the minimum wage of \u00a36.50 an hour for those aged over 21, regularly reviewed pay and gave employees benefits such as staff discounts. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits \u2018should be considered in the round\u2019. In the USA, it is estimated that Walmart\u2019s low-wage workers cost U.S. taxpayers an estimated $6.2 billion (\u00a34.2bn) in public assistance including food stamps, Medicaid and subsidised housing. Morrisons said discounts and profit-sharing took the pay of many over the living wage. Sainsbury\u2019s said it offered employees a discount card, annual bonus and paid breaks. Tesco said it paid, on average, 4-7per cent more than major competitors and had contributed \u00a31.5bn in tax through business rates, employer national insurance and corporation tax in 2014. The British Retail Consortium said pay and benefits packages equated to an average of about \u00a38.40 an hour and the industry had paid \u00a319.5bn in \u2018core business taxes\u2019 last year. Asda, which is part of the US retail goliath Walmart, said pay and benefits \u2018should be considered in the round\u2019",

    "source": "The brave man who stood up against a neo-Nazi at an anti-Islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera. During the Reclaim Australia rallies on the Easter weekend, anti-racism protester Jacob King was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear. Mr King, from Melbourne, told Daily Mail Australia he had his arms spread out because he thought the man was going to attack him and his fellow protesters at Federation Square. Anti-racism protester Jacob King, from Melbourne, had a face off with a neo-Nazi at the Easter weekend's Reclaim Australia rallies . Mr King was raised in Melbourne and says he lived in a multicultural part of the Victorian capital where he was exposed to racial tensions . The anti-racism protester said he learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to 'unlearn' these views' 'A few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines,' he said. 'I remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred, which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion. 'I have however felt this kind of anger before, and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him. 'I placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters. My arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face I was expecting him to attack me. But he didn't. 'As he began to relax I told him there would be no more fighting today. I wasn't expecting him to comply so easily, but I respect him for doing so.' Mr King said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of Melbourne, where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of 'racial prejudice and bigoted views'. 'I learned Islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational,' he said. 'I have learned that the vast majority of Australian Muslims have come to Australia to improve their lives, contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding. Mr King said he had spread out his arms to protect his fellow protesters because he thought the man and his group was going to attack them . Wearing a Harley Davidson sleeveless hoodie, which showed off his sleeve of tattoos, the bald man attempted to start a fight with the protesters against racism, who stood against him in defiance . 'I attended the anti-racism rally because I recognise that the issues raised by the rally co-ordinators are a direct result of the scapegoating and fear mongering of Muslims and other minorities by many in the corporate mainstream media and government. 'I firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all Australians.' Numerous images emerged showing fiery scenes around the nation, but the most striking picture was taken by photographer Kenji Wardenclyffe who captured Mr King during the Melbourne protest against the 'Islamisation' of Australia. The dramatic scenes occurred after Reclaim Australia, an anti-Islam group, organised protests at major cities across Australia, which were countered by anti-racism activists who held rallies in the same locations. The Reclaim Australia event in Melbourne was also crashed by neo-nazis, who spectacularly clashed with anti-racism groups. 'It was very intense,' Kenji Wardenclyffe told Daily Mail Australia. 'The neo-nazi definitely seemed to be instigating, trying to start a fight with the anti-racism group. The other man in the photo stepped in and was trying to keep the peace. 'He kept his hands open, he was trying to stop a fight from breaking out.' The violent intent of the bald man was proven elsewhere at the rally, when he was photographed with one fist gripping another protester's shirt and the other raised to punch the man in the face. Mr Wardenclyffe said he was pushed around by protesters throughout the day, and some of his camera equipment was broken by people attempting to stop him from taking photos. 'It was a very angry atmosphere - it definitely seemed some of the people on the Reclaim Australia side were there looking to start a fight,' he said. 'It was very tense.' Violent intent: At the rally, the man involved in the standoff was seen trying to throw a punch at another protester as the scene descended into violence . One man appeared to be knocked out cold in the melee and was left lying on the ground . The identification of Jacob King comes after a Federal Government MP reported a group 'socialist ratbags' who were seen burning the Australian flag at the rally to the Human Rights Commission. The trio were at a Reclaim Australia demonstration, the same rally where Mr King was photographed. George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' who burnt the flag while protesting against the Reclaim Australia group. 'I have asked the Racial Discrimination Commissioner to investigate the protests to see if they are unlawful under Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act,' Mr Christensen said. 'According to the Act, it is unlawful to perform any action in public that is likely to offend people of a particular race, religion, or national background. If sections of the Act can be applied to one race or nationality it must apply to all, whether a minority or the majority,' he also wrote. The rally was just one of a dozen which took place in cities across Australia on the Easter long weekend, organised by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia.

George Christensen, member for Dawson in Queensland (left) revealed on Tuesday after receiving 'a number of complaints' he had reported the 'clowns' (right) In a video of the event, it also appears to show the moment a man throw a punch at the head of a female anti-racism protester. Despite Reclaim Australia's promise of a peaceful protest, a number of men with shaved heads and tattoos of the swastika appeared at the event and attempted to intimidate anti-racism protesters. Reclaim Australia describe themselves as 'patriotic Australians' who protest against Sharia Law, Halal tax and Islam. They say they want 'compulsory singing of our national anthem weekly in every school in Australia' and want the government to 'refuse entry to anyone who has fought overseas against our ADF or minimum 15 years jail term.' Police were forced to separate  supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country. Crowd numbers continued to grow throughout the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics after the ugly clashes. Police were forced to separate Reclaim Australia supporters and opposing protesters by forming a wall at separate rallies across the country . Speaking to Buzzfeed, photographer Wardenclyffe said one of the anti-racism protesters stood out in front of the rest to stop him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi appeared and pushed through the crowd and began to yell at the (left-wing protestors),' Mr Wardenclyffe said. 'The neo-Nazi then got in the face of the man in my photo with sunglasses who had moved into a position to prevent him from getting through. 'The neo-Nazi yelled at him in a manner which seemed to be an attempt to start a fight, but the guy with sunglasses remained calm and didn't engage.' A clash of anti-Islam and anti-racism groups turned dangerous and violent during protests in Melbourne . Melbourne police formed a barrier between the separate rallies to attempt to disperse the protesters . It comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups has mocked protests . There was never a violent exchange between the groups however the men with the swastika's moved through the crowd taunting the anti-racism protesters. The clash comes after a Twitter account claiming to be linked with anti-Islam groups mocked  protests being held around Australia last week. However, organisers behind the Sydney protest were quick to disassociate themselves with the account. Crowd numbers grew during the afternoon, and some protesters had to be treated by paramedics . Across Australia, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, but Sydney and Melbourne drew the biggest crowd . 'It's not us,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'Ours is @reclaim_aus.' Across the country, 16 rallies were scheduled to take place, with events in Sydney and Melbourne appearing to have drawn the biggest crowds. About 500 people attended the rally held in Martin Place, Sydney, which included speeches from former Australia Defence League member Shermon Burgess and Rise Up! Australia Party NSW President Norm Bishop. Two people were taken away by police officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally . More than 100 police officers, eleven mounted on horses were used to form the separation wall . Several were injured during the violent rally that saw hundreds of people protest for anti-racism . There was a strong police presence throughout the protest, which included riot police. Two people were taken away by officers after they rushed the stage and attempted to disrupt the rally. One took the microphone and told the crowd they should be 'ashamed'. Several more were injured in the combative protests, according to reports.

The mayor's son, who is 17 and a senior at Brooklyn Technical High School will make his decision by the end of the month, leaving de Blasio in a situation familiar to millions across the country. Despite his six figure salary as mayor and six figure rental income from the two properties he and his wife own in Brooklyn, de Blasio is now expected to turn to financial aid to help pay for his son's elite education. Proud family: Dante (left) with his father, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, his mother\u00a0Chirlaine McCray and sister, Chiara outside their home in Park Slope, Brooklyn . 'There's going to be a big challenge in figuring out financial aid and visits and all sorts of stuff,' said Mr. de Blasio to the New York Times last week. But while Dante's choice of college is obviously a private matter, how his parents - as champions of the underprivileged - will fund it, is obviously of public interest. Indeed, the almost prohibitive cost of college for some in the United States is often pointed to as a failing of Democratic politicians and their policies. However, with a salary of $225,000 and his daughter, Chiara, already enrolled at Santa Clara University in California, de Blasio has a good case for financial aid. Ivy League: Dante has been accepted into Yale (left) and Brown (right) Universities and will make his decision at the end of the month . Home for the moment: The de Blasio family moved into Gracie Mansion on the Upper East Side of New York City late last year . Harvard:  $68,050 . University of Pennsylvania: $66,800 . Columbia: $63,440 . Yale:  $63,250 . Dartmouth: $60,201 . Brown:  $59,428 . Princeton: $58,965 . Cornell:  $47,286 . Indeed, her annual tuition, room and board fees come to $55,000 a year and if Dante was to attend Yale, that would come to in excess of $60,000. Faced with more than $100,000 a year in tuition fees, the mayor may not find himself disqualified from seeking aid said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of Edvisors.com, which works in financial aid. 'When you have colleges that are charging 50, 60, $70,000 a year, everybody is going to struggle to pay for college,' he said to the New York Times. However, Kantrowitz admitted in the case of the mayor he is talking about the 1 percent of top earners in the country. De Blasio and his wife Chirlaine McCray received $52,200 in rent from a Park Slope, Brooklyn, home his mother lived in and the family home also in Park Slope they left last year rakes in $4,975 a month. Combined, the two properties value is $2.8 million. However, regardless of how the de Blasio's pay for college, Dante appears to be a strong candidate. He is a champion debater and counts political philosophy his favorite subject according to the New York Times.",

Four-year-old RJ Jackson is one of just 70 people in the world who suffers Netherton's syndrome. His skin appears red and inflamed, and is often covered in dry skin that appears like scales on his body. His mother Valerie Jackson has to regularly cover him in creams to try and prevent his skin drying out. But while out shopping recently, Mrs Jackson was suddenly surrounded by armed police, who had been called by a member of the public. Valerie Jackson, pictured left with her son RJ when he was three months old, was accused of scalding her son after a member of the public mistook his rare skin disease for the signs of abuse. RJ, pictured recently right, suffers Netherton's syndrome, an incredibly rare illness which causes his skin to appear red and scaly . As soon as RJ was born, Mrs Jackson, from Las Vegas, knew there was something wrong with her son, after noticing a red rash spreading across his tiny chest . They reported fears Mrs Jackson had been abusing RJ. 'It just shows the extent of people's ignorance,' Mrs Jackson, from Las Vegas, said. The 35-year-old said she is also subjected to taunts in the street, with other mother's accusing her of burning RJ. 'His skin is bright red and shiny,' Mrs Jackson added. 'I put Vaseline all over him two to three times a day to keep his skin subtle but he is still sore. 'When he was younger he had to have it over his body every few hours \u2013 even in the night. 'We haven't known sleep for about five years.' The mother-of-four said her young son is also targeted by bullies - many cruel taunts being made by adults. 'One woman came up to me and thought he was badly burnt,' she said. 'She said sharply to me, \"Excuse me, your child has caught the sun\". 'I couldn't believe it. But we're used to the staring and ignorant comments. 'I think he is the most beautiful boy in the world. 'He's got a cheeky smile and an adorable giggle.' She said RJ has been treated like an outcast because of his illness, a rare congenital skin disease, which makes skin red and scaly. Mrs Jackson and her husband, Reginald, 40, have to regularly cover RJ's body with creams to  ease his painful symptoms. But she said, both she and her son face cruel taunts from bullies, most of whom are adults . While out shopping with RJ, Mrs Jackson, pictured left with her son in hospital, was suddenly surrounded by armed police. A member of the pubic had called officers reporting the 35-year-old for child abuse . 'It just shows the extent of people's ignorance,' Mrs Jackson said. She said her son has been treated as an outcast, having been denied entry to play centres and facing cruel jibes from people in the street . 'We were denied entry to an indoor playhouse because of his skin,' she said. 'We've had the police called for child abuse. 'We were in Walmart in Las Vegas putting his creams on when we were surrounded by five armed police. Netherton's syndrome is a rare congenital skin disease - a more extreme form of ichthyosis. Sufferers' skin appears red and scaly and can also experience hair, infection and allergy problems. Because red skin can be attributed to several diseases, the condition may not be accurately diagnosed until later in a child's life. Most children with the disease appeared 'scalded' at birth and are slow to gain weight. Their skin quickly loses heat, water and protein and babies are often kept in incubators on special care baby units as a result. They are more at risk of infection because of their inflammed skin. Parents are advised to reguarly cleanse and moisturiser their child'skin, while taking care when holding them. There is no cure for the condition, but in most infants, the symptoms improve with time. As they get older, a child's skin may remain red and scaly, and their skin may be itchy, sensitive or raw, sometimes appearing thicker at the joints. The condition appears out of the blue where there has been no family history. But, it is thought to be genetic, and parents can carry the faulty gene responsible. Source: Ichthyosis Support Group . 'Their guns weren't drawn. The officer asked what was going on. I explained and he apologised. 'But it just shows the extent of people's ignorance.' Mrs Jackson, who is married to RJ's father Reginald, 40, said their son was diagnosed when he was a baby. 'After an emergency caesarean, I knew something wasn't right,' she said. 'As RJ was lifted up and I saw him for the first time, I noticed an angry rash on his chest. 'He was rushed to intensive care where the rash seemed to spread before our eyes, his skin becoming even redder and cracking.' She said her first thought was he was being burnt by the incubator light. 'But he wasn't,' she said. 'No one had any idea what was wrong with him. 'When doctors told me I could take him home two weeks later, I burst into tears. 'I didn't think he was well enough to leave hospital. His skin was crusty and starting to fall off. 'Back home, as he cried and screamed, I felt helpless, and wished there was something I could do. 'He'd scratch at his skin until it bled, so I put socks on his hands to stop him. 'I searched the internet for answers but I couldn't find anything.' She eventually stumbled upon a Facebook group called Netherton's Syndrome Research Group. It had been set up by a couple in the UK whose child,Jack Oldacres has the condition. 'Each symptom was exactly like RJ's,' Mrs Jackson said. 'People from all over the world were sharing stories, swapping tips to help one another. 'I knew this was what he had. I found out Netherton's was a rare strain of the skin condition ichthyosis, affecting one in 200,000 births in the UK. Mrs Jackson was desperate to discover what was wrong with RJ, centre on his sister's lap, and so turned to the internet. There, she found a Facebook group set up by the parents of a little boy with the disease.\u00a0'Each symptom was exactly like RJ's,' she said. 'I knew this was what he had' 'Reginald and I started slathering RJ's skin in Vaseline every three hours, like people on the group suggested. 'We bathed him just twice a week because the hard water dried out his skin too much. 'Each time I'd sit with him in the bath and painstakingly remove all the dead skin.' But, she said, people are still critical of her. 'I'm happy to explain what Netherton's is, but most people jump to conclusions before I get the chance,' she said. 'His brother and sisters are great with him, always helping out and standing up for him. 'Just like any other little boy, he loves throwing around a ball and is usually bubbly and happy, until his skin starts to hurt. 'Right now, RJ is too young to know that people make nasty comments, but I hope as he grows, his condition will be better known. 'It doesn't matter how red his skin is, all I see is a beautiful little boy.'",

Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas in a bid to lessen its dependence on the West . The visit will raise fears the radical left government is looking east in search of alternative sources of finance as it bids to avoid bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, will meet Vladimir Putin (pictured earlier this week) in Moscow today, amid reports that the Kremlin will offer controversial loans and discounts on supplies of natural gas . Ahead of his visit, Mr Tsipras condemned the West\u2019s economic sanctions on Moscow as \u2018a road to nowhere\u2019. But Martin Schulz, the president of the European Parliament, has already warned it would be \u2018unacceptable\u2019 if Mr Tsipras \u2018jeopardised Europe\u2019s common policy on Russia\u2019 in return for Kremlin aid. Kommersant newspaper quoted an anonymous Russian government source last night saying that lines of credit were being offered. \u2018We\u2019re ready to consider the question of providing Greece discounts on gas: the price for it is tied to the cost of oil which has significantly fallen in recent months,\u2019 the source said. \u2018We are also ready to discuss the possibility of granting Greece new loans. But here we, in turn, are interested in reciprocal moves \u2013 in particular, in Russia receiving particular assets in Greece.\u2019 Yesterday Greece demanded more than \u00a3200billion in compensation from Germany for Nazi atrocities during the Second World War. The government unveiled its final calculation for the war reparations stemming from occupation by the Third Reich. The radical left Syriza party says Germany owes Greece nearly 279billion euros, or \u00a3204billion to compensate it for looting and war crimes. The German government says the issue was resolved legally years ago. Greece\u2019s defence minister said it had obtained \u2018stunning evidence\u2019 to support its massive claims for reparations. Panos Kammenos said the country had obtained records held by the US military that review the extent of damage to private and public property during the Nazi occupation. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Mr Tsipras (pictured) condemned the West\u2019s economic sanctions on Moscow as \u2018a road to nowhere\u2019. Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt in a matter of days . The demand comes just days before Greece is obliged to pay 450million euros of its debt to the International Monetary Fund. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, has said the country \u2018intends to meet all obligations to all its creditors, ad infinitum\u2019. Greece suffered a brutal occupation at the hands Adolf Hitler\u2019s forces in 1941. More than 40,000 people are believed to have starved to death in Athens alone. Yesterday a parliamentary committee established by Mr Tsipras for the first time put an official number on the reparations claim. It includes the cost of a 10billion euro forced Nazi loan made by the Bank of Greece and the return of archaeological treasures. The revised figures amount to nearly 10 per cent of Germany\u2019s GDP. Mr Tsipras raised the reparations issue when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month. He has called the reparations question a \u2018moral and ethical\u2019 issue for his country. The new figure was revealed yesterday by Greek deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas. \u2018According to our calculations, the debt linked to German reparations is 278.7bn euros,\u2019 he told a parliamentary committee investigating responsibility for Greece\u2019s debt crisis. Mr Mardas said the reparations calculation had been made by Greece\u2019s state general accounting office. Berlin paid 115m deutschmarks to Athens in 1960 in compensation \u2013 a fraction of the Greek demand. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras raised the issue of compensation from Germany for Nazi\u00a0atrocities during the Second World War when he met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin last month (pictured) Greece says this did not cover payments for damaged infrastructure, war crimes and the return of the forced loan. Germany insists the reparations issue was settled in 1990 legally and politically before Germany reunified. Syriza politicians have frequently blamed Germany for the hardship suffered by Greeks under the tough bailout conditions imposed by international lenders. Ministers have floated the idea of seizing German assets in the country to compensate the families of victims of Nazi war crimes. A poll carried for Greek radio found more than 80 per cent of Greeks agreed with the pusuit of Nazi war debt claims. Yesterday Greek MPs also voted to establish a committee examining the circumstances of its 2010 bail-out by eurozone creditors and the IMF to the tune of 240billion euros. \u2018After five years of parliamentary silence on the major issues that caused the bailout catastrophe, today we commence a procedure that will give answers to the questions concerning the Greek people,\u2019 Mr Tsipras said. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis has claimed the economy was unfairly lumbered with the liabilities that it is now struggling to pay off as its coffers run empty. He has claimed Europe dealt with his country\u2019s bankruptcy by \u2018loading the largest loan in human history on the weakest of shoulders - the Greek taxpayer\u2019.",

    "source": "A mother-of-four calls herself the 'real life vampire' as she has a rare medical condition that makes her allergic to the sun. Lorraine Valentine suffers from the rare disease erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight or UV light. A holiday abroad left the 42-year-old in hospital for six days, as the heat caused her entire body to swell. Her sun allergy means she has to keep herself completely covered, as even a small dose of sun on her skin leaves her in pain. In summer, everyday tasks like picking her children up from school or going to buy some milk become extremely difficult. Lorraine Valentine, 42,\u00a0calls herself the 'real life vampire' as she has a rare medical condition meaning she is allergic to the sun . Miss Valentine suffers from\u00a0erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) which causes her skin to burn and become unbearable itchy when she is exposed to sunlight . Now, as temperatures in the UK are set to soar, she is desperate for a drug that can help her. Miss Valentine, of Bournemouth, said: 'It's always worst when the sun first comes out because I have no time to adjust. 'I have to pull the curtains closed and have to have a fan on, as any heat is painful.' She was first diagnosed with EPP, a rare blood condition which attacks the liver, when she was nine. The condition \u2013 which is incurable - is caused by a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and it can also cause the tissues to swell up. For Miss Valentine, even tasks like going to the supermarket are painful, as UV light reflects up from the floor, burning her skin. EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As . blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy . from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly . damage surrounding tissues. The . nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, . and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing . swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation . 'From March to November I completely cover up when I'm going to pick up the kids,' she said. 'When it's boiling hot and I'm wearing boots, jeans, a big cardigan, scarf and hat, I do get funny looks off the parents. 'They think I'm a bit strange. 'I try and do normal things and not let it affect me.' Her children. Chloe, 18, Elisha 14, Ben, 12 and Josh, 10, are understanding, but the family lives very close to the beach and so Miss Valentine feels guilty she cannot join them when the weather is good. She said: 'It was difficult for them growing up. 'When I was crying because I was in so much pain, they couldn't even hold my hand. 'The slightest touch puts me in agony.' 'They're understanding, but the beach is just ten minutes away. I should be on the beach with the kids, but I can't. 'I'm just trying not to get sunned on. 'Even driving somewhere, my arm is in pain from the sun coming through the window. 'I don't know what I'll do when it gets even hotter.' In June last year, Miss Valentine decided to take her children on a summer holiday to Lanzarote, as she didn't want them to miss out on this right of passage. She bought special UV protection socks to block out sunlight, and booked an expensive apartment right near the pool. She hoped this would mean she could stay indoors if she needed, but could watch her children enjoy swimming. She found the only way she could enjoy the holiday was to stay indoors, emerging at night to go to the beach and explore the town in the dark. 'We went in June because I thought it would be less hot, but how wrong I was,' she said. Last June, Miss Valentine went on a holiday to Lanzarote but was hospitalised for six days afterwards, as the sun irritated her skin. She must wait until the sun sets before going to the beach near her home (pictured) Miss Valentine, pictured on holiday with her 10-year-old son Josh, said her children are 'understanding' but when she is crying in pain they are unable to hold her hand, as any touch puts her in agony . 'Even though I stayed in the shade, I ended up being covered up and in pain wherever I went. 'I had to borrow a fan to sleep and spent most of the evenings in the toilets of the entertainment area putting cold water on my burning feet. 'The kids would give me the ice from their drinks to put on my feet.' When they flew back a week later, her ordeal wasn't over. She said: 'On the plane I cried, trying to sit there for four hours with the pain of the burns. I was in agony. 'I had the air hostesses get me ice in the end. I was in such pain, I was crying and so upset. 'I went through security and left the kids while I raced to get some cold water and some paper towels to try and ease the pain. Miss Valentine, pictured (left to right) with daughter Chloe, 18, Ben, 12, Josh, 10 and Elisha, 14, is now fundraising for other sufferers of the disease . Five hours later, when the family landed in the UK, Miss Valentine was admitted to hospital. She was kept in for six days as her liver wasn't functioning properly; the condition can cause liver damage in severe cases. Now, she is running the London Marathon for British Porphyria Association to help raise funds for other sufferers of the disease. She is hoping an experimental drug called Scenesse will bring hope for her and other sufferers. The drug acts as an anti-oxidant and activates melanin in skin, providing a barrier between the skin and wavelengths of light that trigger the burning and itching. 'I'll battle for this,' she said. 'I've suffered for so long and been through so much. There needs to be treatment available.'",

Jessica Hardy, 23, from Hereford, was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm when she met her new man, Ryan, she tried to burn it off with acid. 'I'm desperate to get rid of it, I have bad dreams about it,' she said on Channel 5 show Tattoo Disasters. Scroll down for video . Jessica Hardy was so desperate to remove her former flame's name from her forearm she used acid . The mother-of-one said she couldn't afford laser removal surgery to have the tattoo removed so when she heard about acid peels for the skin, she thought she had an ideal solution. 'I came across a YouTube video about acid peels so I thought that would be the way to get rid of my tattoo. The kit cost \u00a325 online and I thought \"bargain\".' But instead of removing her tattoo as she hoped, Jessica's dangerous DIY treatment gave her chemical burns. A chemical peel should be applied by a beauty professional as it's designed to damage the skin in a controlled way. The body responds to the damage by healing and rejuvenating the skin - supposedly making it look younger. But Jessica applied the acid without diluting it with water or reading the instructions. As a result, it immediately caused her skin to burn and blister. Jessica's tattoo, left, featuring the name of her ex, and the burns she suffered, right, after applying acid . Six painful applications left Jessica's skin red raw and scabby - and the tattoo remained . She said: 'It felt like someone had poured boiling water on my arm and then got a lighter to it. 'After five minutes it went white and blistered, then started peeling, after three days it went all scabby. 'I didn't want to get it checked in case the nurses thought I was self-harming and I didn't want them to take the acid off me as I still wanted it.' Despite her painful first encounter with the acid, Jessica repeated the treatment another six times. Her skin became red raw, scabby and inflamed - and worst of all, the tattoo was still visible. Realising her DIY treatments were a painful failure, Jessica finally sought the advice of tattoo artist Aaron Mullen. He said: 'I have never seen anything like it before, my first reaction was shock, she shouldn't have taken such a drastic measure to use acid on her skin.' Jess, left, regretted getting her ex-boyfriend's name tattooed on her bikini line, right . He recommended laser removal surgery but said Jessica would have to wait until her skin has healed from the acid burns. Jessica said: 'I regret doing the acid now as I have made process slower. It will be another six to nine months till it will be completely gone.' Another woman keen to get rid of a tattoo featuring the name of an ex is Jess, 23, a dental nurse, from London. She appears on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters this week where she reveals her regrets over her tattoo. 'My boyfriend Jack and I got matching tattoos. Then we broke up and I'm left with his name tattooed on me in an awkward position below my bikini line. 'I regret it every single day. It upsets me and I'm constantly reminds me of what happened when I look at it. I definitely shouldn't have done it, it was a really big mistake,' she said. Jess said the tattoo had seemed like a good idea at the time but now she's been dumped by Jack, it's a permanent reminder of the love she's lost. Jess realised the tattoo was a big mistake when Jack dumped her . The dental nurse managed to get the old tattoo covered up with a new one by\u00a0tattoo artist David Kaffri . Before, left, and after, right, shots reveal how Jess no longer has Jack's name visible on her body . 'I was in love with him and I thought he was in love with me. We got matching tattoos as we thought we could be together forever,' she said. 'A year-and-a-half later he decided he wanted to be single when he went to uni and broke up with me.\u00a0When he broke up with me, I said \"I have your name tattooed on me, what am I going to do?\"' Jess sought the advice of skin expert\u00a0Dr Sam Bunting who told her: 'You have two options - one is to get rid of it altogether and that would involve using laser, which is quite a long, painstaking process and will cause some discomfort. 'The other is to change it so the word Jack isn't distinguishable.' Jess decided on the latter and enlisted the help of tattoo artist David Kaffri, who is no stranger to ridding people of tattoos featuring the name of an ex. He said: 'I like it when people come to me with a tattoo they hate and I can transform it into one they love. 'When I first saw Jess' tattoo, I thought, \"Oh My God that's a bad mistake\". The \"Jack\" is quite substantial. 'Names are a common cover-up. In the tattoo world it's believed to be a jinx, if you put someone's name on your body, it will end up bad.' David designed a feminine paisley style tattoo to cover up the name and Jess was delighted with the end result. She said: 'I love it, it looks amazing, Jack is no more, you can't see the old tattoo at all. I feel like a weight is off my shoulders, it has a closed a chapter for me, now I can finally move on. 'Now I can look down and see a nice tattoo instead of bad memories.' A firm of lawyers is offering a free tattoo amendment service to its clients who are filing for divorce and have their ex-partner's name inked on their body. Stephensons Solicitors LLP is giving its clients the opportunity to turn the tattooed name of their former partner into a work of art. It is also offering to 'cover up' the tattoos which were purchased 'during better times'. Stephensons Solicitors LLP is giving its clients the opportunity to turn the tattooed name of their former partner into a work of art after filing for divorce . The firm is working with entertainment television channel truTV to offer the unique service so clients can get over their ex-spouse. It comes after a new series of television show 'Tattoo Nightmares' will air on the channel. The new service will be trialled for customers who file for divorce at the firm's London office from April 20, 2015. Mike Devlin, from Stephensons' family law team, said: 'It's not unusual for us to see clients who have tattoos of their ex-partners' names.

Robert Lewandowski boosted his own chances of winning the golden boot award at the end of his first season with Bayern, and a second in a row after finishing the league's top-scorer with Borussia Dortmund last season, by netting two goals in a commanding victory for Pep Guardiola's men. Bayern also had a goal disallowed and they struck the woodwork before Thomas Muller added a third, with few doubts from start to finish that they would pick up all three points once again.

Lewandowski is congratulated by his Bayern Munich team-mates after scoring his second goal of the match . It was downhill all the way for Bayern after Lewandowski gave them the lead after only 15 minutes. Thomas Muller put him in position to shoot, but it took a sweet, unstoppable volley to beat Kevin Trapp into the top left-hand corner. Lewandowski could have had a second goal 10 minutes later, but Trapp reacted well to deny him. Bayern had the ball in the back of the net again shortly before half-time, but after consultation with his linesman, the referee ruled out Muller's effort for offside, even though the ball came to him from an opponent. Bayern were again close to a second on the hour mark when Mario Gotze struck the left-hand post, with the ball rebounding out to safety. The hosts did not have long to wait for their second, though, with Gotze's shot blocked by Makoto Hasebe, but the ball fell kindly for Lewandowski to tuck in for his 16th goal of the season. He is now just three behind Eintracht Frankfurt's Alexander Meier. Lewandoski did not complete his hat-trick, but there was a third in the match for Bayern with Muller netting from a tight angle in the 82nd minute, setting the Bavarians up in style for their Champions League quarter-final with Porto in midweek.

    "source": "(CNN)Mullah Mohammed Omar is \"still the leader\" of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. That appears to be the primary message of a biography, just published by the Taliban, of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s. The Taliban's \"Cultural Commission\" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement's website, ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an April 4, 1996, meeting in Afghanistan's Kandahar province when an assembly of Afghans swore allegiance to Omar. Several Afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of Omar's demise. \"There have been a lot of rumors lately about him. Some people are saying that he is not alive,\" said Sayyed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement. \"I think the Taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present,\" Agha told CNN in a telephone interview. Bergen: Why U.S. must stay in Afghanistan past 2016 . The biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the Afghan's jihadi leadership credentials, at a time when ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself \"caliph\" of the world's Muslims. \"The Taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment,\" said Graeme Smith, a Kabul-based analyst for the International Crisis Group. \"Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent. And that is getting noticed by militants across South Asia.\" Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan. To this day, there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader. \"He never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns. No publicity. No interviews. He never used the Internet,\" said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist and expert on Afghanistan who once interviewed Osama bin Laden. Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001. Washington has offered a $10 million reward for his capture. The Taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding. But years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that Omar may have died. The biography challenges rumors of Omar's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule, which begins with prayers, study of the Quran, and then delivering \"orders in a specific way to his Jihadi commanders.\" The publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant's early years, including the detail that his \"preferred weapon of choice\" was the RPG-7, a rocket-propelled grenade. According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province. His father, a \"well-known and respected erudite and social figure,\" died only five years later, apparently of natural causes. Omar studied at a religious school, or madrassa, run by his uncle. The rise of the Communist Party in Afghanistan, and the subsequent 1979 Soviet invasion, interrupted the young man's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed Afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen. For the next decade, Omar commanded rebel groups \"against the invading Russians and their internal communist puppets,\" according to the biography. Along the way, he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye. In one battle, the biography claims, Omar and a fighter named Mullah Biradar Akhund destroyed four Soviet tanks, even though they were armed with only four RPG rounds. The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989. Afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the Taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in Kabul collapsed in 1992. The movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power. The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots \"launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy\" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994. Two years later, the Taliban captured Kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of Islamic law on the rest of the country. While the document denounces the Taliban's post-9/11 overthrow at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of rival Afghan fighters, it makes no mention of the Taliban's alliance with bin Laden and al Qaeda. During a decade in exile, the Saudi-born bin Laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by U.S. raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in 2011. Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years. The movement claims he continues to oversee a Taliban leadership council, judiciary and nine executive commissions, as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan.

Alison Sharland, 47, agreed a \u00a310.35million settlement in a deal that saw her give up her claim to an equal share in her husband's software company. But husband Charlie had lied about the value of his share in AppSense, and she now says she is entitled to more. Battle: Alison Sharland (left) accepted \u00a310.35m from her ex-husband Charles (right) in the belief it was half his fortune. But his firm AppSense was later valued wildly higher, and his stake was said to be worth \u00a3132m . The Court of Appeal found that Mr Sharland, 54, had deliberately hidden information and lied to the court but refused to overturn the divorce settlement. Mrs Sharland will now take her fight to the Supreme Court. The Sharlands, from Wilmslow in Cheshire, married in 1993 and Mr Sharland founded the software company AppSense in 1999. The couple, who have three children, separated in 2010 and agreed to split their assets. But they could not agree over the value of Mr Sharland's share of AppSense, which has grown to become one of the biggest firms of its kind in the world with offices in Silicon Valley, New York, Australia and across Europe. She eventually agreed to accept \u00a310.35million in cash and property and 30 per cent of the proceeds from her husband's shares when they were put on the market. The deal was agreed on the basis that they were worth no more than \u00a332million. But within days of the agreement an initial public offering on the stock market \u2013 which never took place \u2013 valued the company at more than \u00a3460million, meaning his shares were worth around \u00a3132million after tax. Mr Sharland did not dispute that he misled his ex-wife and an Appeal Court judge said his conduct was 'deliberate and dishonest' but the court ruled that Mrs Sharland was bound by the agreement she had signed and refused her appeal. The case will now be heard at the Supreme Court in June. Popular: AppSense provides remote access software to 4,000 companies and was said to be worth \u00a3460m . Landmark: Ms Sharland's case will be heard at the Supreme Court, opposite the Houses of Parliament .",

Mother-of-two Kelly Parsons, from Morden, south west London, has already enabled two couples to have twins and another woman give birth to a boy, thanks to her willingness to go through the painful donation procedure. In the space of 11 months, the 35-year-old's eggs have become twin girls, twin boys and a baby boy. Kelly Parsons, 35, from London (pictured with daughters Emily, four, (left) and 11-year-old Charlotte (right) has donate 50 of her eggs to help childless couples conceive . Kelly said: 'Despite the pain, it was worth it to bring joy to families that would never be able to have kids naturally. 'To have the urge to have kids and not be able to have them must be heartbreaking. I'm only a little part of making these babies. 'I am sure the parents will probably curse me in the middle of the night when they have to do bottle feeds.' Kelly and her train dispatcher husband Dean, 41, had a daughter, Charlotte, now 11, in 2003.

Kelly then decided to start donating her eggs to other childless couples, in a bid to help as many families share the joys of children. Kelly and her husband Dean, 41, (second right) struggled for eight years to conceive Emily, with Kelly suffering three heartbreaking miscarriages .

'Dean wasn't totally on board but because I have supported him through so many crazy things, he knew it was my turn. 'You can only donate your eggs until you are 35, and because I was 33 at the time I felt like the clock was ticking.' Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries, and after a few months she will have stored up enough for them to be harvested. She said: 'After the first time I donated eggs I was knackered but so happy I'd done it. Kelly injected herself twice a day with drugs to stop her period and stimulate her ovaries . In all, the nurse has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies - twin boys, twin girls, and a baby boy . 'A week later I got a call to say five of them had been fertilised and two had been implanted into the mum-to-be. 'They'd also frozen the others so they could have more kids in the future. 'From then on I was on tenterhooks, hoping her body would accept the embryos. 'Although I knew nothing about the couple, I really felt a connection to them.' In all, Kelly has donated eggs three times, leading to three successful pregnancies. Also, a number of her eggs have been frozen for future use. Controversially, Kelly has told her 11-year-old daughter that she has brothers and sisters. Controversially she has told her daughter Charlotte that she has brothers and sisters out there - and she has elected for her egg donor kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 . She also chose for the kids to be able to contact her daughters when they turn 18 - as she wants her girls to know their half siblings. She added: 'I would love to see if they look like me and am curious to meet them when they grow up. 'Charlotte is so excited by the thought she might get to meet her brothers and sisters one day. 'She even wants to donate her eggs because she thinks what I've done is amazing. 'The people that I've helped have babies have been through the menopause or cancer meaning they could never conceive naturally. Imagine having that urge to become a mother but not being able to have a baby, it must be devastating. 'Life can be so cruel and I'm just thrilled I could bring happiness to other women.'",

    "source": "Depraved militants fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq have savagely beheaded a man accused of practising sorcery and witchcraft. Harrowing images of the killing are being shared by bloodthirsty supporters of the terror group on social media and show the victim lying in a pool of blood with his severed head resting on his back. One of those distributing the sickening pictures is a man claiming to be a British militant fighting for the terror group who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Bakr al-Britani. The gruesome photographs are understood to have been taken near Tikrit in Iraq's Salah al-Din province, where members of the Iraqi Army and allied Shiite volunteer militias have had great success in forcing the terrorists to withdraw in recent weeks. Scroll down for video . Sick:\u00a0This photograph shows the blindfolded and bound man wearing a brown jumpsuit as a bearded terrorist lifts an 18-inch long kukri machete high into the air ready to behead the defenceless victim . Harrowing: This image - far too gruesome to publish in full - shows a close-up of the man's lifeless body, with his severed head resting on his back and surrounded by prayer beads . The exact crime the beheading victim is accused of committing is not known, but images of his violent death were uploaded to Twitter saying he was a 'sorcerer'. Terror: One of those distributing the images is a man claiming to be a British ISIS jihadi who goes by the nom de guerre Abu Bakr al-Britani . The first photo shows the blindfolded and bound man wearing a brown jumpsuit as a bearded terrorist lifts an 18-inch long kukri machete high into the air ready to behead the defenceless victim. A second image far too gruesome to publish in full then shows a close-up of the man's lifeless body, with his severed head resting on his back. It is the exactly the same position British and American hostages are placed in after being savagely beheaded by ISIS' British executioner in chief Mohammed Emwazi, also known as Jihadi John. Surrounding the man's lifeless body are dozens of brightly-coloured prayer beads. It is likely the man had been selling the items, which ISIS terrorists consider bid\u2019ah, meaning a 'reprehensible innovation'. As is so often the case with ISIS' brutal public executions and amputations, huge crowds are seen in the streets to witness the man's beheading. Young men and children and seen lining up in a town square and jostling for position as they struggle to get a better view of the atrocity. Horror: The execution in Salah al-Din took place as Iraqi forensic teams working in the nearby, newly liberated city of Tikrit started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers . Girsly task: ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing the 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher - an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit . The execution in Salah al-Din province took place as Iraqi forensic teams working in the nearby, newly liberated city of Tikrit\u00a0started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain the bodies of up to 1,700 soldiers brutally murdered by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry said the work started on Monday on eight locations inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing took place. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. Later, the Islamic State group posted graphic images online that appeared to show its gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after loading the captives onto flatbed trucks and then forcing them to lay face-down in a shallow ditch, their arms tied behind their backs. Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 death. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein . One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' \u00a32 billion-a-year income.",

    "source": "Between the bad behaviour and the bad advice, Raheem Sterling is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now. Hippy crack and shisha pipes, mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject Liverpool\u2019s offer of close to \u00a3100,000-a-week, might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running. After all, as Liverpool know only too well, you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to Barcelona. But the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world\u2019s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the \u00a340million upwards Liverpool will demand to secure the services of a player like Sterling. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe (left) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . The recent images of Sterling will be a concern to clubs considering parting with \u00a340million to sign the star . Luis Suarez secured a move to Barcelona despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch . English football would appear to have yet another flawed talent, another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with. There is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as Sterling found himself on Monday night. Becoming as good as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo \u2014 Gareth Bale even \u2014 requires more than ability alone. It requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in English players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs. As the latest photographs show, this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with Brendan Rodgers tomorrow. It is more of a health issue than an image issue for Liverpool\u2019s manager, as Sterling did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide \u2014 unlike Tottenham\u2019s Kyle Walker, for instance. But Rodgers will also suggest to the unsettled 20-year-old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place. Ibe was also pictured smoking shisha with Sterling in fresh pictures that will further embarrass Liverpool . It appears that Liverpool stars Sterling and Ibe had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking Fanta . Sterling celebrates after scoring Liverpool's opening goal in Monday night's 2-0 win over Newcastle United . Becoming as good as Lionel Messi (right) or Cristiano Ronaldo (left) requires  more than just ability alone . He should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble, like Jack Wilshere and Ravel Morrison. Of course, it will not be the first time Rodgers has questioned Sterling over the company he keeps. He has publicly criticised the player\u2019s agent for his role in the England international\u2019s ongoing contract saga \u2014 and with some justification given how badly things have been handled. But Rodgers\u2019 criticism of Aidy Ward is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who, at times, has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems. Ward is credited to some extent with the fact that Sterling actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work. He is said to be polite and courteous to the staff, is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was due to speak to Sterling to remind him of his responsibilities . Ibe and Sterling were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe (bottom right) Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present \u2013 including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. For all the uncertainty over his future, Rodgers and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship. The relationship between Ward and Sterling is more personal than the typical agent-player dynamic. They appear to be business partners judging by the company details of Trinity Goals Limited. While Ward has 80 per cent of the equity, the remaining 20 per cent is divided between Sterling and Arsenal\u2019s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. But Ward has an almost paternal relationship with Sterling, with the player affectionately addressing him as \u2018Uncle Aidy\u2019. Clearly, Sterling needs that kind of guidance. His team-mates might joke that he has \u2018more kids than caps\u2019 when he admits to one daughter \u2014 he occasionally brings two-year-old Melody Rose into training \u2014 but denies a second child. But Sterling\u2019s own childhood was a difficult one. Born in Jamaica and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of Kingston, he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north London in the shadow of Wembley Stadium. Back in Jamaica, when he was still only nine, the father he claims never to have known was murdered, reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush. In London, Sterling had to leave his primary school to attend Vernon House, a school in Neasden for children with behavioural problems. \u2018As a young kid I had anger issues,\u2019 Sterling admitted in a recent interview, although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him. While Chris Beschi once had to warn Sterling he could end up \u2018in prison\u2019 if he failed to change his ways, he remembers someone who was \u2018amazingly intelligent in so many ways; a brilliant thinker\u2019. Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Beschi told the Mail on Sunday two years ago that he would walk Sterling and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new Wembley. It proved a source of inspiration, with QPR recruiting him when he was 10. Steve Gallen, academy director during Sterling\u2019s time at QPR, remembers a young player whose \u2018mentality\u2019 was \u2018his strongest attribute\u2019. He also described him as \u2018a coach\u2019s dream\u2019. Gallen also praised Sterling\u2019s mother \u2014 Nadine is a nurse \u2014 for her positive influence. When Sterling moved to Liverpool at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his \u2018house parents\u2019. Eventually, however, Nadine moved to Merseyside, living with her son until around a year ago. Judging by recent events, she might need to move back in. Ward should think very carefully before he makes his next move, because the last few weeks have amounted to a PR disaster. Sterling acknowledges young QPR supporters - the Liverpool star joined the Loftus Road club at the age of 10 . There is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player. Particularly when Ward can point to the fact that, right now, a player of Sterling\u2019s value to Liverpool is earning roughly \u00a36m-a- year less than Daniel Sturridge; \u00a335,000-a-week compared with \u00a3150,000-a-week. There was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in Sterling\u2019s contract, which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances. By the end of last year, Liverpool actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of \u00a3100,000-a-week. And if Sterling looks at Sturridge and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall, he probably has a point. Such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal. Managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door. Sterling has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer. The academy staff at Liverpool consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club\u2019s system and Rodgers has described him as the finest young player in Europe. Roy Hodgson was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer\u2019s World Cup in Brazil, aged just 19. It is simply the way Ward and Sterling have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable. The unauthorised interview with the BBC; an article in the Sunday Times magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song \u2018from the Kop\u2019. The Kop duly obliged on Monday night against Newcastle, informing the scorer of their opening goal that his \u2018agent is a ****\u2019. Sterling says it is not about the money, that it is about playing Champions League football and winning trophies. But don\u2019t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal. Don\u2019t take the dispute into the public arena if it\u2019s not a pay rise you\u2019re after, but a transfer. Sterling celebrates with Ibe after scoring in Monday's Premier League match at Anfield against Newcastle . Ibe pictured during Monday night's win over Newcastle, which kept Liverpool in the top four chase . If Ward\u2019s intention is to take Sterling away from Liverpool this summer, the player is not making his job easy right now. Alarmed by recent events, Arsenal are already thought to be going cold on the idea. The agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs, that Sterling is a good Christian boy who says his prayers every night and rarely, if ever, touches alcohol. He drives a Range Rover; an expensive but sensible car. He was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a \u2018beautiful house\u2019 back in Jamaica. Ward might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20-year-old. Trouble is, Sterling is not like any other 20-year-old. He is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions. Does he want to be the best? And if so, is he prepared to make the sacrifices?",

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino would prefer Kane to rest at the end of his first full campaign rather than compete in the tournament in the Czech Republic. Spurs and England have been in talks for some time without reaching an agreement. Tottenham forward Harry Kane has been in superb form this season, netting 30 goals for the club so far . Kane scores Tottenham's third goal during the 3-1 win against Newcastle United at St James' Park last week . FA Chairman Greg Dyke (left) stands with Reading chairman\u00a0John Madejski during the FA Cup semi-final . Tottenham boss\u00a0Mauricio Pochettino would like Kane to be rested at the end of his breakthrough season . Dyke, however, said: 'I got a call from Harry Kane's agent recently just to say how much he enjoyed playing for England recently and how much he wants to play for the U21s this year in the Euros and that's important. 'If you're a young English boy coming through the system you should want to play for England.' It was part of a St George's Day message from the FA chairman designed to strengthen the bond between England's patron saint and its football team. 'England has the best football team in the British Isles and if England as a football team does well then England is a united country,' Dyke said. 'Football plays a big part in England and should play a big part in St George's Day.' Kane, with 30 goals for Spurs this season and one on his England debut last month, is due to join Tottenham's end-of-season trip Malaysia and Australia. He is scheduled to return at the start of June and, if he is part of Gareth Southgate's U21 squad, he could be away on international duty until the start of July, after which he will need a break and would miss the start of Pochettino's pre-season plans. Kane scored on his senior England debut against\u00a0Lithuania in March, continuing his fine form this term . England, meanwhile, have pulled out of the annual Victory Shield U16 tournament for the home nations in an effort to save an estimated \u00a3120,000 a year. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England have contested the trophy every year since 1947 but the FA announced it will withdraw for the foreseeable future. They are keen to target more fixtures against stronger European nations \u2013 and Dyke is reviewing costs to find \u00a330million for his grassroots revolution. Earlier this month, Sportsmail revealed the England non-league team, known as England C, was under threat from these cuts.

    "source": "A hotel owner believes he has found the perfect solution for revitalising his flagging business - by converting it into a swingers' paradise. Jon Huxley, 46, hopes to cash in on the Fifty Shades of Grey effect and attract guests from the gay and swinging communities at his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent. He plans to install sex swings, bondage rooms and dungeons and have rooms of differing sizes to cater for couples and multiple groups. Jon Huxley, standing outside his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent, is looking at 'developing' his premises to cater for swingers . He hopes the craze in Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his object of affection Anastasia Steele, can help transform his business. He said: 'We have plans to attract tourists from the gay and swinging community for short breaks and weekends of adult fun. 'Obviously a lot of equipment will need to be installed like swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight. 'We would be having these events each weekend and accepting tourist guests during the week. 'Food and drink will be provided as part of an all-inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment.' Mr Huxley will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film Fifty Shades of Grey . Clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured. 'It is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business. It is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off.' Mr Huxley said he has decided to appeal to the swinging community after rowing with the council over the use of Grade-II listed building. Jon Huxley hopes the change in hotel ethos can see his business grow . For months he had been in a dispute with Shepway District Council over complaints about its use as a house of multiple occupation for homeless people. Councillors voted for an enforcement notice after neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour. Mr Huxley said the complaints had been about anti-social behaviour and noise from the street rather than from inside the property. He said he would not need a council entertainments licence because there would be no live entertainment, loud music or dancing. Asked what locals might think of his plans he said: 'I do not involve myself in what happens behind their closed doors and they should not involve themselves in what happens behind mine. 'I have bills to pay and the income has to come from somewhere. They have seen fit to take away my current source of guests so I have to look for other sources. 'I can't attract tourists because there isn't a market for it anymore and that is a fact I have to deal with. 'This is a growing market and I can't think of any other market that is growing at the rate of this one. 'Fifty Shades of Grey has been a phenomenal success and this is a sleeping giant in terms of the opportunities that are there.' Mr Huxley, who has owned the hotel for 13 years, said the special weekends would be controlled through advance bookings rather than being open to casual callers. They would be advertised predominantly through the internet or word of mouth with some advertising in 'appropriate places'.

The Bosnia international has regularly been linked with other clubs during his time at the Britannia Stadium, and although his current deal has just over 12 months to run, Scholes believes they can match the 27-year-old's ambitions. 'Clearly Asmir is a terrific goalkeeper and we are very keen to keep him at the club,' he told The Sentinel.\u00a0'I think when you've got extremely good players it is only natural that there will be speculation about their future. Stoke City are hopeful they can keep hold of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic as he enters the final of his contract . Begovic has regularly been linked with other clubs during his time at the Britannia Stadium with Stoke . 'These players are also very ambitious and I include Asmir in that. He is a very focused, very talented and very ambitious young man. 'He wants to make sure he can play at the very best levels his abilities will enable him to and to have a very good and successful career in the game. We hope that we can fulfil all of those things at Stoke City.' Begovic's deputy Jack Butland recently extended his contract until 2019 while manager Mark Hughes also agreed new terms on an extension. Scholes said that, and the recruitment which has taken place since they opted to change their manager for the start of last season, highlighted how they were planning for the future. 'If you look at the deals we have done since Mark Hughes arrived then almost without exception they have been good deals and very good footballers,' he said. Liverpool's Glen Johnson sees his shot saved by Stoke goalkeeper Begovic at Anfield previously . Stoke chief executive Tony Scholes is hopeful they can keep hold of  Begovic despite his contract ending . 'It's about making sure you are adding to the quality and improving all of the time, but we have also got a strong eye on making sure that we have got a depth of squad. 'We have to make sure that when we have injuries to the incredible scale we have had this year that the players are able to come in and do a good job - and the players who have come in this season have done an exceptional job. 'You also have to make sure that you are planning for next year and the years beyond.

Not so for those with endless funds. One company is offering the chance to dive 12,500ft below the surface of the sea to explore the ship at the bottom of the Atlantic. The tour takes in sights like the famous grand staircase, the ship's huge anchors and the Marconi Room, from which the world's very first SOS was broadcast. The once-in-a-lifetime privilege is being offered by luxury concierge service, Bluefish, and does not come cheap, setting you back a whopping \u00a341,000 ($60,000). Unique experience: Travel to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean to the wreck of the Titanic with concierge service Bluefish . Haunting: Beams of light illuminate the features of the tragic ship, which sank on April 14, 1912 . A port side forward expansion joint on the boat deck of the bow section of the shipwreck. Travellers will learn about the ship in a series of lectures in addition to the dive . The hefty price may seem like a lot but more than 40 people have so far booked the trip to the Atlantic Ocean depths. Director of Bluefish, Steve Sims said: 'We have sent over 40 people down and they have been housewives to technology billionaires, the Titanic really does capture the minds of a wide crowd. 'Bluefish is known for providing the amazing and rare and the Titanic fits both those criteria. 'More people have been into space than set eyes on the Titanic.' Guests will stay aboard the Akademik Keldysh ship at sea and wait for suitable conditions to see the Titanic up close. The transport to the ocean floor is a MIR I or II submersible which are capable of reaching ocean depths of 20,000 ft (98 per cent of the ocean floor worldwide) and withstanding intense pressure. The submersible is constructed of nickel steel and can hold one pilot and two passengers, providing a personal encounter of the vessel. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship. As well as this divers can spot harrowing personal items such as shoes or bags caught between the metal rust, which serve as a poignant reminder of the tragic human loss. The starboard railing near the bow of the Titanic. Expeditions take place in a\u00a0MIR I or II submersible, which is able to withstand the water pressure\u00a012500ft below the surface . The wreck of the Titanic is situated around 676 kilometres from Newfoundland, almost four kilometres below the surface . Not only does the trip offer a truly unique ocean expedition, but it also offers the chance to learn about the majestic vessel in depth. You will take part in a series of lectures and briefings, revealing latest findings about the 269 metre-long liner. There will also be a ceremony commemorating the tragic events and remembering all those who lost their lives on\u00a0April 14, 1912. Meals, accommodation and personal video are also included in the somewhat hefty price tag. The RV Keldysh and MIRs have made over 15 expeditions to the site of the wreck and have made over a hundred dives. The unique dive takes 11 or 12 hours in total and once you reach the ocean floor powerful lights let you see the main features of ship . Once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! More people have been to space than have explored the Titanic, and the dives aim to collect data for scientific experiments . The aim of the dives is not just tourism, but also obtaining imagery from the site, data and physical samples from the wreck to further research and be used in ongoing scientific experiments being conducted by worldwide scientists . Since\u00a0Deep Ocean Expeditions began dives to the wreck in 1998 no artefacts have been removed from the site . However it hasn't been plain sailing for Bluefish trips to see the famous ship.\u00a0Only eight people took the voyage between 2002 and 2006 and after the recession put a strain on luxury spending. 'The recession hit and everything went to pot,' Simms told\u00a0CNN Money. After years of fruitless searching by many organisations the wreck of the RMS Titanic was found by Dr Robert Ballard in 1986. Since that time multiple dives have been conducted by some of the world\u2019s five deep diving submersibles, representing France, USA and Russia . Now the service has picked back up and guests can experience the whole package, or opt to have everything apart from the dive to the wreck, for \u00a36,820 ($10,000). The bespoke concierge service offers a range of elaborate services, besides the Titanic expedition. Whether it is racing half a million dollars Mercedes in the Mojave Desert, a Virgin Galactic flight into space, or having a James Bond experience in Monaco with Bond girls and being rescued by American Navy Seals, Simms sees no challenge as impossible for the right clients. The luxury does not come cheap, with membership to the club being \u00a33,414 ($5,000) per annum before you have forked out for any experience. Star-crossed lovers! Many were captivated by the\u00a0James Cameron film, released in 1997, which saw the affluent Rose (played by Kate Winslet) fall in love with poor Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) on the Titanic's fateful voyage .",

Warren Sapp made many highlight-reel plays during the course of his Hall of Fame career, but the former NFL star might be better remembered for his off-field exploits thanks to a new video. Sapp was arrested the night after the Super Bowl in Phoenix, Arizona, on a prostitution charge after an\u00a0alleged incident involving two women. In a police video released on Monday, Sapp, 42, cries, cackles and confesses about what exactly went down back on February 2 in the Renaissance Hotel. In the video\u00a0obtained by TMZ, Sapp admits he paid for oral sex and that 'everyone got naked' after he 'put $600 on the table' in his hotel room. The two women who were arrested along with Sapp were Britney Osbourne, 23, and 34-year-old Quying Boyd. Sapp continued: 'We're in the bed and I start taking pictures of the two ladies naked and doing what they're doing. 'So I'm taking pictures because I'm silly like that sometimes.'

Britney Osbourne, 23 (left), and\u00a0Quying Boyd, 34 (right), were both arrested in Phoenix along with Sapp . The incident allegedly took place very early on February 2 at the Renaissance Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona . He told police one of them began performing oral sex on him - they stayed safe and used a condom - but the other annoyed him by chatting. When it became too much, Sapp told her: 'Why don't you use your mouth on me, instead of using it. 'Just go. Just move. Your girl\u2019s doing a good job. I\u2019ll be done with her in a minute.\u2019 After Sapp asked to have sex, the woman who was performing oral sex asked for a tip. That request apparently prompted an argument and the first video of the interview ended. In surveillance video that was taken in the hotel lobby, Sapp (left) can be seen walking and talking with a man . In the second clip, Sapp is informed he will be going to jail and then left alone in the room. He began repeating, 'Oh my God. Oh my God' before asking: 'Are you kidding me?' In between cackles and sobs, Sapp added: 'I'm going to be booked as a John. 'I gotta go to jail?' Police became involved after a female contacted them and said she had been assaulted. Both women had minor injuries that were consistent with a struggle, but Sapp denied he assaulted them. Sapp was fired from his job at the NFL network and could get six months in jail and three years probation if he is convicted. He was charged with soliciting prostitution and two counts of assault. Sapp\u00a0was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. He is 42 . Osbourne is facing a prostitution charge of her own while Boyd was cited for failure to register with the state as an escort. They have both denied the charges. Sapp played 13 seasons in the NFL, first with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and later with the Oakland Raiders. He was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in 2013 - his first year of eligibility. In recent years, Sapp, a divorced father of two, has been struggling with financial problems, which culminated in 2012 when he filed for bankruptcy. In November of that year, the Super Bowl champion was forced to sell his  home in Florida for $2.1million. Months earlier, Sapp auctioned off a 240-pair collection of rare Air Jordan sneakers worth $6,500 to pay his creditors. Sapp has yet to comment on the video.",

    "source": "Lucky: Selena Dicker, 38, outran the avalanche on Mount Everest in the wake of the Nepal quake . A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker \u2013 who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche \u2013 described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise \u00a345,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London, \u00a0escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge . Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers \u2013 from South Africa \u2013 managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London \u2013 Chloe Pincho and Brennan White \u2013 were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover. Amanda Holden said her sister Debbie was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness .",

The competition aims to find a man 'who possesses all of the qualities that make up today's well-rounded, active, health-conscious and thoughtful guy'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cover star? Aydian Dowling is the transgender man widely touted to be on the cover of Men's Health . Miles ahead: Though the public vote only counts for 10 per cent, Aydian clearly has a huge backing . Family life: Aydian, who transitioned in 2009, lives with his wife of three years Jenilee in Oregon . A spokesman told Yahoo: 'We're looking for a guy who's physically fit, who lives a healthy lifestyle, leads by example, has overcome some challenges in his life, and somebody who our readers can learn something from.' With a fan base of thousands on Facebook, Aydian is touted as a role model for transgender, gay, bisexual, and heterosexual men in showing that he has struggled, achieved, and helped others. Aydian, who started taking 'T' (testosterone medication) in 2009, lives in Eugene, Oregon, with his wife of three years Jenilee. Beyond his hit YouTube channel, the entrepreneur has launched his own sportswear brand, Point5cc, which he says is 'designed to highlight transgender pride'. His contestant application reads: 'The battle that can come with the mirror can be completely dark and engulfing.

He adds: 'On days \"off\" I love to go with my wife, Jenilee, out on hikes around the Pacific North West.

    "source": "A man who murdered a mother and daughter in their own home by bludgeoning them with a hammer and repeatedly stabbing them with scissors will spend at least 32 years behind bars. Lesley Jonathon Cameron was jailed for life on Tuesday for the horrific December 2013 murder of Maureen Anne Horstman, 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman in broad daylight at their Warwick home, in Perth, WA. Cameron, who was 19 and at the time, also raped Tamara but it is not known if she was alive or dead. A used condom with DNA evidence was found after the incident,\u00a0The West Australian Supreme Court heard. Maureen Anne Horstman (left), 67, and her 26-year-old daughter Tamara Alexandra Horstman (right) were bludgeoned with a hammer and stabbed to death with scissors in their own home in December 2013 . Prosecutor James MacTaggart said Cameron's behaviour was 'sadistic' and he went on a 'killing spree'. 'It's violence for violence's sake,' he said. Mr MacTaggart said while it may have started out as a burglary, Cameron was aroused and then 'sexually violated' Tamara. The court heard Cameron first entered Tamara's bedroom where he hit her over the head twice before going into Maureen's bedroom and striking her once to the head. He then returned to Tamara's bedroom and raped her. Lesley Jonathon Cameron has been jailed for a minimum of 32 years for the horrific crime. He described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' Cameron's lawyer Dominic Brunello said it was an unplanned and chaotic attack and Cameron panicked. Mr Brunello said his client had a troubled childhood and was 'drug-addled' at the time but was now sorry. 'He makes no excuses for his conduct,' Mr Brunello said. The court heard Cameron described himself at the time as a 'walking time bomb' and that he told police he had taken ice and speed. Justice Eric Heenan noted Cameron had a criminal record that was 'virtually without interruption' since he was 10 years old. In a victim impact statement, Tamara's twin brother Nicholas Horstman, who discovered the bodies, said his sister was a dedicated student, loyal friend and widely loved. Maureen and Tamara are seen here in a family photo with Tamara's twin brother Nicholas.\u00a0Tamara's father said he has suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked' He and his father accepted Tamara's university graduation certificate the day after her funeral. Tamara's father said he suffered many sleepless nights and was 'internally wrecked'. Justice Heenan said the women were going about their lives peacefully at home and the crime showed the vulnerability of the community. 'This is one of the worst types of murders one can imagine,' he said. 'It is the kind of offence which every member of the population dreads because it shows the insecurity and vulnerability of everybody in the community to random crime,' he added. Justice Heenan noted there was a possibility Cameron would remain a threat if he did not address his mental health and substance abuse issues. He said just because Cameron was young did not make him any less dangerous but there was a possibility of rehabilitation. Outside court, Nicholas Horstman said he was very happy with the sentence. 'However, no sentence will ever be long enough,' he said. 'To my family, close friends and the wider community, thank you for your support over the last 16 months. I'm truly thankful.'",

    "source": "The force wasn't with everyone during the Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens panel held at California's Anaheim Convention Center on Thursday. Carrie Fisher, 58, who is reprising her role as Princess Leia, and Mark Hamill, 63, who is Luke Skywalker, were arm-in-arm on the stage just before the second trailer for the December film was rolled out. Not on hand was Harrison Ford, who is the franchise's Han Solo. Producer Kathleen Kennedy explained the 72-year-old was 'resting' after miraculously surviving a March plane crash in Los Angeles. Scroll down for trailer... Together again:\u00a0Carrie Fisher, who is reprising her role as Princess Leia, and Mark Hamill, who is Luke Skywalker, were arm in arm on the stage in Anaheim on Thursday before the second trailer for Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens was rolled out . In recovery mode:\u00a0Not on hand was Harrison Ford, who is the franchise's Han Solo. Director JJ Abrams explained the 72-year-old was 'resting' after miraculously surviving a March plane crash in Los Angeles; here the actor is seen in July after an accident on the Star Wars set . It was announced early on that Ford would not be a part of the panel (though later he was the high point of the trailer). 'He's not here today but he's in everyone's thought, Harrison Ford, he's a total bad a***. 'The amazing thing about Harrison \u2013 and I don't think anybody out there will be surprised \u2013 is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors,' producer Kennedy said. The A team: Kathleen Kennedy, pictured center, said,\u00a0'The amazing thing about Harrison \u2013 and I don't think anybody out there will be surprised \u2013 is he is the only person who could make an emergency landing on a golf course in front of two doctors'; to her left is director JJ Abrams . They have a bond: Both Hamill and Fisher thanked the fans for their support over the decades . The vet meets the new faces: Fisher smiled as she posed with John Boyega and Daisy Ridley . Kennedy said he was home resting, and getting well as fast as he can. 'I can't even begin to tell you how much he wanted to be here,' she said. 'When we open the movie, Han Solo will be very active in what we are doing.' Abrams then chimed in. 'He's doing great and he's working hard,' Abrams said. 'I had respect for him all my life, but I've never had more respect for a guy until I saw how he landed that plane. The way they were: (from left) Hamill, Fisher and Ford in the original Star Wars movie in 1977 . 'He's more of a hero in that move than in all the films he's been in,' he added. 'By the time the movie opens he will be very actively involved.' Abrams also called the veteran actor, who is married to Calista Flockhart, a 'real hero.' Ford was also injured on the set of the Star Wars film and production was brought to a halt. But he recovered without any long-term issues. Fisher came out on stage in a black blazer and red skirt. Next was Peter Mayhew, who plays Chewbacca. Last was Hamill. The audience went wild for over 10 seconds. 'Chewie, we're home': Ford was featured at the end of the trailer for Star Wars VII . She's taking care of him: Ford's wife Calista Flockhart has been seeing to her husband's needs; here they are pictured in 2008 . When asked about her iconic hairstyle, Fisher said, 'The buns are tired now so I don't think we'll have the futuristic buns but we will have an alternate that will not include the metal bikini.' She also thanked the fans and made a twisted joke about how she is glad people have played with toys of her - referring to her Princess Leia dolls - which drew laughs. Hamill added, 'George originally called the film the most expensive small film he ever made.' He then thanked the fans for their 'passion.' 'My entire adult life I have felt such love from you. You're more than just fans, you're family.' On the run: Daisy and John can be seen running from an explosion in the trailer . R2D2 then appeared on stage and an image from the movie was shared with the robot in it. The 'tinkerers' were also brought out to talk about working with the droid. Next came BB-8, a rolling droid that appeared in the first Star Wars VII trailer. It made noises while circling R2D2. Daisy described her character, 'She is a scavenger and very solitary until she meets another character and that's when the adventure begins.' Down for now: An aircraft is buried in sand on a new planet . Oscar added, 'He's been sent on a mission by a certain princess and he meets John Boyega's character and their fates are forever intertwined.' John then said he would not confirm whether he was a Stormtrooper or not. Anthony Daniels also made the event - he plays C3PO. And then came the trailer. No fear: A pilot is seen in battle in the film that has a December release . The clip was the first time the vet character Han Solo, played by Ford, was seen. He was joined by Chewbacca at the end of the trailer and is heard saying, 'Chewie, we're home.' The trailer opens on what appears to be the newly revealed desert planet Jaku. As a speeder races across the sands we see an ancient downed Star Destroyer and a skeletal X-Wing, which clearly crashed there from orbit decades ago. We then see an unknown pair of hands holding the mangled mask of Darth Vader, melted and disfigured from the Sith lord's funeral pyre at the end of Return Of The Jedi. A hint of the old era: A skull of Darth Vader - aka Anakin Skywalker - is shown in the beginning of the clip . We hear Hamill's voice reprising a line from the 1983 film: The force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. My sister has it. He then appears to hand a lightsaber to another unseen character - a strong suggestion Luke Skywalker has had a child. Daisy, Oscar and John are then all introduced in the clip and it is hinted that they are in allegiance. Harrison appears with Chewbacca only at the very end. The menace is always there: Stormtroopers are also seen in the trailer, and they are located in a snowy location . Where is this?: In the opening scene, a desert planet is shown that is not Tatooine, but rather a new place JJ Abrams said was Jaku - it is not known how that is spelled or what lives there . Star Wars Celebration is a multi-day festival produced by Lucasfilm that's dedicated to Star Wars past and present. The most recent event, held in Germany in July 2013, had more than 20,000 attendees. During the panel, JJ talked about his love of the franchise. 'I was 11 years old when Star Wars come out,' he said. 'That moment transported me. It was the first time a movie made me laugh that way.... the film was brilliant and had such heart and the biggest thing for me was that it had such hope. 'Shooting in Abu Dhabi was an incredible thing. Shooting Star Wars is a Western and a fairy tale... shooting in Abu Dhabi was just that,' he added. The stars in real life: Oscar, Daisy and John side by side at the panel . The star in the film: Oscar as a pilot, Daisy as a scavenger and John, who at one point is a Stormtrooper . They then flashed a scene of the team in the desert. 'It's a planet called Jaku, people thought it was Tatooine, but it was Jaku.' He did not explain how Jaku was spelled or where it was. In November the first trailer came out and it lasted only 88 seconds. Opening some 30-years after Return Of The Jedi, the teaser kicked off with British actor Boyega, playing Finn, racing across a desert landscape dressed in full Stormtrooper regalia. A parched, disembodied voice tells us of an 'awakening' and reminds us of the dual energies that are 'the dark side... and the light.' The droids showed up too: Also on stage were the new robot BB-8 (left) and the old robot R2D2 (right), which looked a bit banged up . Behind the scenes: Not only was the trailer shared, but so were shots from the making of the movie . British actress Ridley is the next new star to appear as she drives a hover vehicle towards a desert town, while Oscar Isaac is seen as a fighter pilot, looking rather like a young Luke Skywalker when he's headed for the Death Star. The first trailer also delivered what was initially suggested during the forthcoming film's development - a clear departure from the over-indulgent use of CGI that blighted parts one, two and three of the science fiction saga. It also confirmed the welcome return of the iconic Millennium Falcon, and it is seen dodging laser blasts in a brief battle sequence. A new lightsaber made its debut, complete with a sword-like hilt, as an ominous cloaked figure marauds through a dark, snow-layered forest setting. The film opens December 18, 2015. The man with a plan: JJ Abrams spoke about the exciting project on stage . The veterans: Mark, Carrie and Anthony Daniels waved to the crowd of loyal followers . Dark side: Several Storm Troopers attended the event as they walked in a uniform line while standing in the background at the event . The gang's all here: Several Star Wars diehards posed for snaps together while dressed in their costumes .",

    "source": "One in five American women are willing to undergo dangerous beauty treatments in order to achieve the ideal look, despite the risks that these procedures pose to their health. According to a new study, while just over half of women worry about the long term damage of beauty treatments, nearly a fifth would still pursue a treatment to get the right look - even it it proved hazardous to their health. Seven per cent, meanwhile, have actually had allergic reactions. The survey, conducted by beauty research organization\u00a0LQS and Associates, looked at the lengths 1,000 American women go to in order to enhance their appearances or copy a celebrity, and the potentially disastrous consequences they might face in doing so, including hair loss, skin swelling, and overly painful procedures. The cost of beauty: Women often don't realize the dangers of salon treatments before sitting in the styling chair . Respondents cited the hairstyles of actresses Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock, as well as signer Jennifer Lopez, as celebrity favorites, with 53 per cent also noting that they get skin, beauty, and hair ideas from pictures and videos of famous personalities. But LQS and Associates warns against attempts to emulate these looks on a regular basis. A-listers like Beyonce, Paris Hilton, and Selena Gomez all sport weaves and extensions, but their beauty regimen is not always adaptable to the average person. 'Many of those glamorous looks can do more harm than good, leading to long term problems,' said LaQue Gushon-Harris, president of LQS and Associates. 'Unfortunately, most women are not even aware of the repercussions.' Mr Gushon-Harris explained that women who get weaves and extensions often deal with hair loss from traction alopecia, the gradual recession of the hairline due to tight hairstyles that pull at hair follicles over time. The survey also revealed that the top five beauty and cosmetic treatments favored by women in the US include manicures, pedicures, hair coloring, teeth whitening, and perms. However, frequently demonized treatments like tanning beds and facials also make the top 10. Good hair day: Jennifer Aniston (left) and Sandra Bullock (right) have the top two favorite celebrity hairstyles . Long-term risk? According to\u00a0LaQue Gushon-Harris, president of LQS and Associates, Beyonce's weave could be causing permanent damage to her hair follicles . Despite the dangers, the majority of women say beauty treatments make them feel better about themselves and improve their looks. Nearly half believe these procedures boost their confidence. And in a country where one-sixth of women go to great lengths to look like their favorite celebrities, knowledge of dangers might not even stop them. When asked if they knew for certain that their treatments would cause permanent damage, four per cent said they would continue anyway and six per cent would continue, just not as much. Most women, however, remain confident that their treatments are safe, and 67 per cent say they would stop if they learned what they were doing to themselves was unhealthy. It comes down to education, says Mr Gushon-Harris, who travels the country teaching women about the dangers of cosmetic treatments. The study also found that 56 per cent of the respondents want more information on the side effects of their treatments and almost a quarter don't have any idea of the dangers of their treatments. It's a possible push for beauty salons to be more transparent. 'It is very important to be educated about whatever it is that you are doing to your body,' he added. 'These damages can be lasting and life changing.'",

    "source": "An eight-grade girl accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in adult jail while awaiting trial, a judge. A defense petition to return 14-year-old Jamie Silvonek to the juvenile facility where she was initially sent after the body of 54-year-old Cheryl Silvonek was discovered last month was denied by Lehigh County Judge Maria Dantos on Friday. District Attorney Jim Martin had opposed the petition on behalf of the teenager, who is charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy. Her boyfriend, Caleb Barnes, 20, who is from El Paso, Texas, but was stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland, is charged with homicide. JamieSilvonek, the eighth-grader accused of conspiring with her soldier boyfriend by text message to have her mother killed must remain in an adult jail while awaiting trial, it was ruled on Friday . Cheryl Silvonek's body was found with stab wounds in a shallow grave about 50 miles northwest of Philadelphia, and her vehicle partially submerged in a pond a few miles from the family home. Jamie Silvonek was sent to the county jail this month after she was charged as an adult and is in the women's housing unit, away from older inmates, county officials said. Authorities said Barnes and the teenager met in October, when she was 13, but she told him she was 17. Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. The teen's mother found out about their relationship in early March and ordered them to end it. A day later, the teen told Barnes in a text message, 'I want her gone,' police said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home. When they arrived, they found Barnes, the girl and Silvonek's husband, David. The girl and Barnes were in an upstairs bedroom and the father was still asleep, CBS 13 reported. Barnes was previously charged with criminal homicide, abuse of a corpse and statutory sexual assault. There is evidence he had sex with the girl shortly before the killing, according to police. The 14-year-old was charged earlier with abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence and hindering apprehension. 14-year-old JamieSilvonek allegedly conspired to kill her mother Cheryl Silvonek with her 20-year-old boyfriend 'because she disapproved of their relationship' Barnes confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, and that given the age disparity 'there has to be some type of duress or coercion'. He said his client 'cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom' and she feared for her life and that of her father. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life .

Now, one alien hunter claims to have spotted what he believes to be a bunker on the red planet, with armed people peering out of its windows. Andre Gignac says he made the 'stunning discovery' in a photograph released by Nasa and taken by the Mars rover Opportunity. Scroll down for video . A conspiracy theorist claims to have spotted what he believes to be a bunker on the red planet, with armed people peering out of its windows (shown by the dotted red line) He says he became suspicious about a 'dark spot' on the rim of the Endeavour crater he had found in the original image, and so took a closer look. 'I was stunned. It was a massive panoramic window built in the inside wall of the crater,' Gignac told Cryptozoology News. 'You can see a person behind the bunker's window,' the 58-year-old added. He claims that the 'bunker' 'could also be a corridor leading to a bigger bunker'. 'Also, not far from this bunker are missiles, rockets and structures deployed in a circle,' he says. 'Bunkers have been spotted in previous Nasa pictures, some might be caused by shadows or lack of resolution that doesn't give enough detail to clearly see if the structure is a bunker or not,' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO investigations Manual, told Dailymail.com . Andre Gignac says he made the 'stunning discovery' in a photograph released by Nasa and taken by the Mars rover Opportunity . Pictured From left to right, are structures, missiles and rockets Cignac claims he found in Nasa's image . Cignac claims he became curious about a 'dark spot' on the rim of the Endeavour crater he had found in the original image, and so took a closer look . 'Others have claimed that bunker pictures were taken by the European Space Agency, Mars Express orbital vehicle. 'These were explained as being of erosional features or caused by the way the pictures were stitched together. 'Whatever the \"mundane\" explanation I think we are more fascinated by the idea that there are people secretly living beneath the surface of Mars and they are part of some secret space program. 'Such a project would need vast resources and would be very hard to keep covered up, yet many think this is what is happening and that these activities are being carried out in conjunction with one or more alien species.' The latest discovery follows a spate of supposed 'sightings' of Martian civilisation. Last year, a Maryland-based UFO hunter spotted what he believed to be a 'decorative' box on the red planet. Other objects found in images of Mars include what some UFO hunters claim to be a fossilised iguana (left). Stock image of an iguana is pictured right . The so-called 'coffin' was found by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. The image pictured inset has been edited . The 'coffin' was discovered by Will Farrar from WhatsUpintheSky37 as he trawled through a library of pictures sent back by the Mars rover Curiosity. Many scientists believe that seeing strange objects, such as a 'coffin' on Mars, is simple a case of pareidolia. This is a psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random places. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places, especially the faces of religious figures. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the word Allah. For example, in September 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers in Singapore to pay homage to the Monkey god. Another famous instance was when Mary's face was a grilled cheese sandwich. Images of Jesus have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of Marmite and in a potato. 'This little box sure does look like a modern coffin concrete liner,' he wrote on his YouTube channel. 'As well as the stonework on the back part of the hill that looks like stairs or some left over stonework from some old civilisations constructions.' Alien researcher Scott Waring of the UFO Sightings Daily said he believes the coffin was made from a stone-like substance. 'What would it take to get Nasa to turn the rover around and examine the contents of this box?,' he said. But while its strong lines have captured the imagination of UFO bloggers, scientists believe sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random places. It has evolved so that human eyes can spot faces within their environment, and to help them recognise friends in a crowd. Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there. 'I stand ready to be convinced that I have possibly hallucinated. I won't mind being told that I'm wrong,' Cignac says. Last year, UFO enthusiasts claimed to have spotted Barack Obama's head on the Martian surface. They say a panoramic image from 2005 taken by the Spirit rover shows a rock shaped uncannily like his head .",

Mark Hawkins reportedly barricaded\u00a0himself inside the Greyhound-style bus in the parking lot of a Walmart in Salem, Oregon, after he was approached by police, who believed him to be wanted. Seconds later, Hawkins, who was being hunted in Lane County for failing to appear on a charge of delivery of a controlled substance, allegedly fired his weapon from the front of the large vehicle. The bullet struck a police dog named Baco in the head, prompting an exchange of gunfire between officers and Hawkins. Numerous law enforcement agencies in the area then rushed to the scene. Scroll down for video . Wrecked: Mark Hawkins, 49, who was holed up in a vintage blue bus  has been shot dead following a seven-hour standoff with SWAT officers. Above, the bus is pictured in a wrecked off after the standoff on Friday . Finally out: A law enforcement official is pictured dragging Hawkins (whose limb can be seen in the official's grip) out of the Greyhound-style bus, which was situated in the parking lot of a Walmart in Salem, Oregon . Shot dead: The suspect (left and right), who was wanted in Lane County for failing to appear on a charge of delivery of a controlled substance, had barricaded himself in the vehicle after he was approached by police . In the hours after the first shot, which occurred shortly before noon on Friday, SWAT officers and police fired more than a dozen rounds of tear gas at the bus in Turner Road - but to no avail. They locked down all shops in the area, including the Walmart, as they attempted to force Hawkins out of the vehicle. They finally decided to ram an armored car into the blue bus, according to KOIN.com. In incredible scenes, SWAT offers drove the car into the bus, punching holes in the larger vehicle. But the suspect apparently still refused to comply with officers and 'continued to brandish a handgun'. At around 6.30pm, police shot at the suspect multiple times. He was hit and wounded by nine bullets, causing him to slide out of the bus. He was then taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died. '[Hawkins] has since died of his injuries,' the Salem Police Department said  on Friday night. It is not yet known whether the bus belonged to Hawkins - and if not, how he managed to get into the vehicle. The officers involved in the shooting  -  Officer Joshua Edmiston, Officer Vincent Dawson and Officer Sean Bennet - have now been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, police said.

Many of the sightings can be put down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies, but some enthusiasts believe it is because of rise in alien activity. The interactive map was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB. Click on the map below to find out if aliens have been spotted in your neighbourhood . A map shows sightings of extra-terrestrials around the world in the last 76 years \u2013 and seems to suggest we have more cosmic visitors than ever. It was\u00a0created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB . Published in the QuantBait website, it begins in 1933 with the first UFO sightings being spotted over California and Nebraska in the US, the UK and France in Europe, and locations in Japan and Australia. The number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s across the world, according to the map. In the US, sightings documented during the 1940s include the famous Battle of Los Angeles and Roswell UFO Incident. On February 25 1942, radar operators spotted a UFO within 120 miles (193km)  of Los Angeles that moved at incredible speed before vanishing. The UFO map (pictured) was created by writer Levi Pearson, who used a UFO sighting dataset from the National UFO Reporting Centre and open source software from CartoDB. Its shows that the number of sightings increases dramatically between the 1940s and the 1960s . Explanations for UFO sightings are just as vague as for aliens themselves, and could be down to the development of drones and new aircraft technologies \u2013 or a genuine rise in alien activity. An illustration of a flying saucer is pictured . The map shows a dramatic rise in the number of UFO sightings during the 1950s and 1960s. While this could indicate ore alien activity, the CIA recently claimed that half of UFO sightings in the US were linked to them testing U2 spy planes (pictured) at altitudes of 60,000 ft . An artillery officer said he saw 25 craft flying at 25,000ft (7,620 metres) and other eye witnesses reported seeing swarms of balloon-shaped objects flying at around 200mph (320km/h). Fearing the city was under attack, officials fired at the aircraft but no evidence of damage was ever found, prompting people to speculate the UFOs were from another world. And in 1947 the Roswell Incident occurred, which is still the source of speculation today. The US military claimed they recovered a secret research balloon that had crashed, but conspiracy theorists say the wreckage of an alien craft was discovered and hidden. While it\u2019s possible that there were more UFO visitations during the decade, officials at the time put it down to people being nervous about World War II, and seeing objects in the sky. Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, told MailOnline: \u2018Sightings of strange things in the sky have been reported for centuries, though it was only with them being labelled as flying saucers or UFOs that people began to realise that this is a worldwide phenomenon. \u2018UFO sightings often come in sudden and short-lived periods, which ufologists call flaps or waves. 'Often specific locations seem to be highly attractive to UFOs, and these locations are known as UFO window areas or UFO portals. The British version of Roswell reportedly took place over Christmas in 1980. It occurred in Rendlesham Forest, Suffolk, next to RAF military bases. Soldiers reported unusual lights and when they investigated, found a metal object with coloured lights (UFO map of UK shown) Thanks to the rise in popularity of sci-fi films and an increase in UFO sightings, aliens were very much in the public consciousness in the 1960s. Here, Dr H Allen Hyneck, an astrophysicist at \u00a0Northwestern University says at a press conference in 1966, that a photo claiming to show a UFO is a time exposure of the crescent moon and the planet Venus . The British version of Roswell reportedly took place over Christmas in 1980. It occurred in Rendlesham Forest, which is next to RAF military bases. Soldiers reportedly saw unusual lights and when they investigated, found a metal object with coloured lights. But as they approached the 'craft', it moved away, frightening farm animals. The incident is unexplained, but some people say the lights were reflections from a nearby lighthouse and the craft may have been a secret weapon. On March 31, 1992, high speed white objects were spotted in the skies and an officer at RAF Cosford and Shawbury spotted a large triangular craft hovering at 200ft, which was humming and shining a spotlight. The incident was reported to the Ministry of Defence and sceptics say it could be explained by a nearby police tracking helicopter or a Russian rocket re-entering the atmosphere. \u2018In the UK, Warminster, Cannock Chase and Bonnybridge are the most famous UFO window areas.' Bonnybridge is known as the UFO capital of Scotland and there are said to be some 300 sightings every year, although not all of these are shown on the map. Cannock Chase in the Midlands has been a UFO hotbed since the1960s when there were first reports of a crashed craft, and earlier this year, residents reported seeing slow-moving aircraft making a loud buzzing noise moving across the sky. There appear to be repeated UFO sightings in the Midlands shown on the map during the 1960s, with clusters of activity also seen in the Netherlands, Germany and other parts of central Europe. There is a marked increase in sightings on the map during the 1950s and 1960s, all across the US shown on the map. It is worth noting, however, that some famous sightings are missing, such as reports of flying saucers over Washington DC in 1952. Last year, the CIA took credit for half of the UFO reports in the 1950s and 1960s and as sci-fi films gained popularity such as Invaders from Mars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it\u2019s possible aliens were higher in the public conscious than ever before. The CIA said that UFO sightings were directly correlated to them testing U2 spy planes at altitudes of 60,000 ft (18,288 metres) - a feat of engineering that was not possible before. Reports suggest that the CIA soon realised that UFO sightings lined up with the place and time the U-2 planes were flying, but that they purposefully chose not to let people know that what they were seeing were not aliens to keep the tests firmly under wraps. However, this does not explain the 1966 Westall Encounter in Australia, when some 200 students and teachers in Melbourne claim to\u00a0have\u00a0seen a UFO land in a suburban field, before taking off again. But\u00a0once again, sceptics\u00a0say the UFO was an experimental military aircraft. The map also shows a famous UFO sighting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1986, when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 UFOs, which showed up on radar. The mysterious flying objects disappeared when fighter jets gave chase, leading some people to say the UFOs were technically-superior alien craft. However, a British space researcher called Geoffrey Perry claimed that the UFOs were actually pieces of debris thrown out of the Soviet space station, Salyut-7, which burned up in the atmosphere,\u00a0Stylist\u00a0reported. In Europe, the map shows many sightings over Belgium, between 1989 and 1990, which is known as the Belgium Wave. At that time, some 13,500 people claimed to have seen huge black triangles flying silently through the skies. While the incident was tracked by Nato radar and investigated by the country's military, nothing unusual was found and sceptics believe the sightings may have been of ordinary helicopters. From the mid-1990s onwards, the explosion of sightings intensify on the map, with large concentrations over the West Coast and the whole eastern half of the US, from Texas. The map shows the whole of Europe ablaze with circles indicating UFO sightings, as well as areas of western Africa, India, South East Asia and South America. Some believe that the increase in sightings over the past 20 years could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet, which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before (UFO map focused on Australia pictured) The map shows a famous UFO sighting in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 1986, when military aircraft were sent to intercept 20 UFOs, as well as numerous sightings in South Africa and other parts of the continent, which have been reported in recent years. UFO maps of South America (left) and Africa (right) are shown . The global nature of the sightings suggests this could be down to the widespread uptake of the internet, which allowed people to share sightings more easily than before. Mr Watson said: \u2018With the coming of the internet it is easier for people to report UFO sightings and this is probably one reason for a rise in sightings. \u2018We should also acknowledge that Chinese lanterns and the increased deployment of drones are responsible for greater amounts of sightings.\u2019 In 2008, a guard at Yeni Kent Compound in Turkey claimed to have filmed UFOs and the footage is said by some to be among the most important UFO images. There is no explanation for the encounter, in a similar way to a sighting in Warden in South Africa, where a police officer said he saw an enormous oval-shaped, orange light in 2000. In 2007, eyewitnesses in Kolkata, India said they saw a fast-moving, glowing \u00a0object which was a cross between a sphere and a triangle. And in 2013, in Bracknell, Berkshire, two glowing 'flying saucers' were photographed hovering in the skies above a pub and new of 'visitors' quickly spread online. John Wickman, Chairman of the British UFO Association (Bufora) said: 'Technology is vastly progressing and a very large number of sightings no matter where they are in the world can be attributed to modern military craft that have been misidentified.' \u2018Just because a UFO report is made does not mean that the object originates from anywhere other than the Earth,\u2019 he cautioned. Mr Watson said: \u2018On the other hand, the internet allows access to greater amounts of information and enables us to discuss reports from lots of different angles, from the extreme sceptical viewpoints to the most outlandish conspiracy rumours. \u2018With or without the internet, ufologists tend to think that only five to 10 per cent of sightings are of anything exotic and worthy of further investigation.\u2019",

The 39-year-old was on the ninth hole when he found himself 470 yards away from the pin with the ball nestled in pine straws. However when he followed through, the four-time champion at Augusta slammed the club into a root, causing him to wince and grab his hand in agony. It forced the joint out of place, but Woods shunned medical attention and simply pushed it back in himself. Tiger Woods looks in agony after his club came into contact with a tree root on the ninth hole at Augusta. He later revealed his wrist bone had 'popped out' of place . The 39-year-old is clearly in agony as he is forced to drop his club on the follow through . He then grabs his wrist and winces. After finishing his round he revealed that his wrist bone had popped out - so he was forced to put it back in . His reaction prompted concerns he may have suffered another injury setback. However he managed to shake off the scare and finish his round. Woods, playing in his 20th Masters tournament, ended up at 5-under-par on 283, tied for 17th. 'It hurts; it definitely hurts,' Woods said. 'I didn't know there was a tree root there. I drilled the club straight into it. It didn't move, but my body kept moving. 'There's a little joint that popped out, and I was able to somehow put it back in, which didn't feel very good. 'At least I got it back in; I could move my hand again. It's sore. I'm not going to be lifting any weights for a while.' He also admitted that he may not return to the course for a while. Despite finishing\u00a013 strokes behind 21-year-old winner Jordan Spieth, this was Woods' best finish in a tournament in over a year. Spieth became the youngest winner since Woods when he was given the coveted green jacket on Sunday. After his final putt he went an embraced his tearful childhood sweetheart Annie Verret. The Texan native, whose life-long dream has been to win the Masters, was undoubtedly being watched on television at home by his youngest sibling, Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Ellie has helped to keep Spieth grounded, according to their mother. Speaking after his win, Spieth said: 'It was very nerve-wracking today. I didn't sleep all last night. Just got out here and got in a little rhythm. With two major champions right behind, I couldn't let up. It was the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport. It was remarkable. He added: 'I saw my family and friends right behind the green there, and knew it was going to be a done deal. I'm still kind of in shock a little bit.' Spieth's victory comes a year after he lost a bid to become the youngest player to win the Masters. This year, he did not let anyone get closer to him than three shots following his record start. He closed with a 2-under 70, missing a 5-foot par putt on the final hole that would have set another record.

A bad-tempered managing director repeatedly punched his wife in the face after he shouted at her for not doing the ironing. David Bulman, 55, and his wife Lubova had a row after he criticised her for not doing the chores or checking to see if his shirt buttons were missing. His wife threw all his shirts outside, but he followed her and shouted at her before he pulled her hair and punched her several times in the face. Neighbours called the police after Bulman drove away, damaging a gate post and a van, leaving his frightened wife with a black eye and a lump on her head. Bulman was given a 12-month community order after he pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm at Bristol Crown Court. Recorder Jim Tindal also ordered Bulman to complete rehabilitation and programme requirements, and not to intimidate, harass or pester his wife. He said: 'As a result of an argument in which things were said on both sides you lost your temper, you lost control and you behaved appallingly. 'You punched your partner several times and got into your car. 'You hit a wall and your blood was up. You were not thinking straight and as a result your partner sustained unpleasant injuries.' He added: 'We sometimes say behaviour is out of character. 'Sometimes the public is a little bit sceptical about that, but in your case it is true. 'You have had almost 40 years of keeping out of trouble in which you have been running a business, employing people and participating in society in a number of ways.'

They argued about the ironing and he attacked her, before leaving in his car from their home in Clevedon. Sam Jones, defending, said Bulman had not been in trouble with the law for 30 years and had suffered a stroke a number of years ago. He added: 'These proceedings have had a punitive element for him. He shows deep remorse and very real upset at the breakdown of the relationship with his wife. 'Mr Bulman is a successful businessman, the managing director of a company in Bristol. 'It has a significant turnover. He is a director and they employ 15 people.' Bulman was also ordered to pay \u00a3500 compensation, \u00a3260 court costs and a \u00a360 victim surcharge and as he left court the recorder told him: 'The onus is on you to keep your temper.'",

    "source": "Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston took a surprising step in denying five Football Association charges for text messages during which he labelled a supporter a \u2018retard\u2019. The unpopular chief initially had until March 30 to reply, but was granted an extension. His appeal is expected to be heard by a separate FA panel next month and Oyston still faces a ban from football activities. Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston has decided to contest his FA charge for allegedly abusive text messages . Oyston - who has been the constant target of fan protests over the course of the Seasiders\u2019 worst season for decades - is also looking at a hefty fine and mandatory four-hour FA education course. The shocking text messages, seen by Sportsmail, emerged just before Christmas when he sent a series of vitriolic volleys to fan Stephen Smith, who he told to 'enjoy the rest of your special needs day out'. Oyston later apologised for his part in the exchange, and it is understood his denial boils down to a reasonable expectation of privacy. The development comes just days after pensioner Frank Knight, a lifelong fan, was ordered to pay \u00a320,000 in damages for alleged defamatory remarks made on his Facebook page. The footballing world rallied around Knight, with a kickstarter fund amassing the thousands he needed to pay. On announcing Oyston\u2019s denial, an FA statement read: \u2018It is alleged that the misconduct constituted five breaches of FA rules, and that during the text message exchange, Mr Oyston used abusive and/or insulting words towards a supporter of Blackpool FC. \u2018It is further alleged that each of these five breaches of FA Rule E3(1) is an \u2018Aggravated Breach\u2019 as defined in Rule E3(2), as each included a reference to disability. \u2018Mr Oyston has denied the charge.\u2019 It is not the only example of foul-mouthed exchanges to have happened in a bitter campaign. The Oystons are extremely unpopular at the club, and fans have been protesting against their ownership . In a another rant from Oyston, who also had abuse hurled at him, said: 'Stop texting f******, you shouldn't have ever started as you are one tiresome f***** that should spot trains not watch football. Get a life and consider yourself banned from the stadium. 'You are banned because I think you are a p****. 'Impossible to have a meaningful conversation with such a f******* as you.' Oyston also joked with other fans that plans are afoot to see Blackpool, a Premier League side four years ago, spiral down to the Conference, with another text reading: 'I am a never-ending nightmare revenge mission'. Their relegation to League One was confirmed early last week and they are on course to tally the lowest number of points ever in the modern day second tier. There is to be a mass demonstration against their despised reign prior to the final game of the season against Huddersfield next Saturday. The content of the vile messages first emerged just before Christmas and Oyston came in for widespread condemnation. Anti-discrimination group Kick It Out registered their disgust, with local paper the Blackpool Gazette scrapping the chairman\u2019s weekly column with immediate effect. Supporters have been protesting against the Oystons before matches and then not attending the games . Blackpool\u2019s off-field problems have become such a distraction that the club posted an article on their official site clarifying their stance on ongoing defamation cases, one involving a national newspaper. Their lengthy statement on Tuesday read: \u2018Reluctantly, the company has been compelled to take action against a number of individuals and organisations following online postings or articles that contained vile lies and abuse about the club, its directors and players. To date, three settlements have been agreed with several further cases pending against other individuals and a national newspaper. \u2018Any payments from court or agreed settlements will be anonymously distributed to Fylde and North West based charities. The rationale of this policy is to avoid the adverse reaction towards such charities that accept the donations, as was the case when the club donated the first settlement to a leading, vibrant and forward thinking charity in Blackpool, Fylde and Wyre. \u2018The latest settlement of \u00a320,000 will be paid over four years in equal installments, with the charities set to benefit as and when the money is received by the club. \u2018For the avoidance of doubt, the club, directors, management staff and players would far prefer not to take any defamation action against any individual or organisation, but must continue to take action where necessary to combat the false, misleading stories and lies that are being perpetuated.\u2019",

    "source": "Concerns are growing over Russian ships that have docked in a once-secret  naval base in the Arctic. Military leaders in Norway are nervous about its powerful neighbour's presence on its 'strategically important' coastline following a spike in tensions between Russia and NATO nations. Some experts have criticised the shutting down of Olavsvern Naval Base - a huge complex buried in mountainous terrain near the town of Tromsoe - which has been closed since 2009. But fears have once again peaked after three Russian ships spent the entire winter docked deep within the mountain hideaway which was once a heavily guarded military facility. Show of strength: Norway's military leaders are growing concerned after three Russian warships spent the winter docked inside a closed naval base (file photo) deep inside the country's mountainous terrain . Aggression: In February, RAF planes intercepted two Russian bombers (file photo) which had flown into Irish territory and forced a passenger jet to divert its course . Force: And late last year, the Russian navy anti-submarine ship Severomorsk (file photo) and three other Russian ships had to be escorted out of the British channel . It was originally shut because the country's leaders thought the threat from Moscow was reduced, despite its massive Northern Fleet which is base in the nearby Kola Peninsula. Norway's former vice admiral said shutting down the base was 'pure madness' while other critics say their submarines now have to travel hundreds of extra miles to protect the region. This is far from the first time Russia has flexed its military muscles in other countries' territory. In February, a passenger plane had to be diverted to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled airspace without warning. The disruption on February 18 was thought to have occurred during the same incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort the Russian vessels. That move was perceived as a show of strength by Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine conflict after Prime Minister David Cameron accused him of challenging the 'territorial integrity' of Kiev. It followed a separate incident when the Royal Navy had to intercept a Russian warship which strayed to close to the UK while passing through the English channel the same month. The Neustrashimy-class warship \u2013 equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes \u2013 was monitored and escorted by a heavily-armed British frigate. Cat and mouse: Heavily-armed HMS Argyll follows the Russian warship (back left) as it passes through the English Channel in February . Intercepted: Footage released on Russian TV showed the moment two RAF jets escorted the Russian bomber in February . Concerned: They are worried by this perceived show of strength from Moscow (Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured) and its presence on its 'strategically important' coastline . And late last year, the HMS Tyne had to escort another Russian destroyer and three other boats from the Channel as they passed through the Strait of Dover after carrying out military exercises in the North Sea. Since January 2014, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included: . Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert. Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel. Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth. Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland. Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne. Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland. Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain. Elinar Skorgen added: 'We are the only country along with Russia to have a permanent presence in the Barents Sea, where we share a common border. Obviously our navy should be stationed there, including our submarines. If the ships aren't there where they are needed, they might as well be scrapped altogether.' The Armed forces put the base - which cost over \u00a3390million to construct - up for sale on Norway's version of eBay. It was eventually bought for just \u00a33.5million by a Norwegian businessmen and was rented out to Russian research vessels which were reportedly linked to the country's state-owned energy giant Gazprom. Its landlord Gunnar Wilhelmsen said: 'There are no longer any secrets surrounding this base... Not since the military and NATO agreed to put it on sale over the Internet, along with photographs of every nook and cranny.' Many military experts are now worried by the the potential for Russian military activity aboard the research vessels. A former second in command for the Norwegian military said: 'Russia is a country where the state has a say over all commercial or semi-state business. It's clear, very few people know what happens on these vessels.' Jan Reksten believes the sale of Olavsvern was 'a double loss' as 'Norway's armed forces lost an important base and now there are Russian vessels docked there'.",

    "source": "The FBI has cleared the Tulsa County Sheriff\u2019s department in the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man by a volunteer deputy earlier this month. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said in a press conference on Monday that the special FBI agent in charge of the state of Oklahoma, Jim Finch, had informed him of the investigation's results earlier that morning. 'He told me the FBI has completed their investigation and they found no wrongdoing at the sheriff's office,' said Glanz, who also said there were no civil rights violations in the incident. Scroll down for video . Sheriff Stanley Glanz told a press conference on Monday that the FBI had informed him of the result of the investigation into the shooting of Eric Harris by reserve deputy Robert Bates on April 2 . Robert Bates, a 73-year-old reserve deputy, says he mistook his handgun for a taser and accidentally shot Eric Harris while attempting to help other deputies take Harris into custody. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the April 2 death and faces four years in prison if convicted. On Monday Glanz said he didn't believe reports that Bates' training records were falsified and he claimed the volunteer 73-year-old insurance executive had been properly trained. But the sheriff stopped short of saying Bates was qualified to use the gun he used when he killed Harris earlier this month. 'Mr. Bates has been to the range several times and is qualified and that is documented,' the sheriff said. When asked if Bates was trained on the specific gun he fired at Harris, Glanz said: 'That is something we're still looking at and it will be part of the administrative review.' Harris' family has questioned whether Bates was adequately trained. The Tulsa World newspaper, citing unnamed sources, has reported some of Bates' supervisors were told to certify him after he failed to meet some qualifications. Bates has disputed those reports. His attorneys released some of his training records over the weekend, including certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Robert bates has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the April 2 death of Eric Harris and faces four years in prison if convicted . Glanz also said Monday that action will be taken against two deputies at the scene, including one caught on video cursing at Harris as he lay dying. The sheriff said both have received threats and have been reassigned for their own safety. 'Through our administrative process we will review what those officers did and will take some administrative action,' the sheriff said, but didn't provide specifics. He said nine officers were involved with the sting, and that two officers had pinned down Bates when the shot was fired. The sheriff said on Monday that Bates had been his insurance agent and that they'd known each other for about 25 years. He said they met when Glanz's oldest son was in high school and got into a car accident. Bates served as Glanz's re-election campaign manager in 2012 and has donated cars and equipment to the sheriff's office. Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Sheriff Glanz said he had no plans to resign and that his office's reserve deputy program meets national standards set by the Commission on Accreditation For Law Enforcement Agencies. A Harris family attorney is scheduled to speak on Monday afternoon to address Bates' training records. Monday's news conference followed the release on Saturday of official records detailing Bates' training and certification. The records included certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of information include records Bates, of Tulsa, copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seemed to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. Sheriff Glanz said he doesn't believe reports that Bates' training records were falsified and that he has in intention of resigning over the incident . Bates spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy disputed earlier this week a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said. Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork.",

    "source": "Lord Janner escaped justice after the UK\u2019s top prosecutor over-ruled the advice of two of the country\u2019s most senior QCs, it emerged last night. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was encouraged by two aides to charge the Labour peer with historic sex crimes. Both Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Scroll down for video . Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders 'ignored the advice' of to top QCs to charge Lord Janner . Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse werer made . In particular Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided that it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his advanced Alzheimer\u2019s, sparking a storm of controversy. The latest revelation came as Mrs Saunders endured a barrage of criticism for ending the case before it could reach court. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 could have satisfied the need to get the bottom of the appalling claims against Janner whatever his mental state. Figures from across the political spectrum are clamouring for the decision be reversed amid fears of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said the concerns were justified. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something \u2018very strange\u2019 about the decision and Health Minster Norman Lamb called for the matter to be settled by the courts. Accusing the CPS of \u2018heinous errors\u2019, Mr Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of people with dementia being brought to trial. \u2018My concern is that because the DPP and indeed the Crown Prosecution Service at a local level have made errors in this case, heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so,\u2019 he said. \u2018This matter should not be concluded by the DPP and should be brought before a court. \u2018There is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial. With allegations as serious as this it seems to me that this is the right approach.\u2019 Mr Hunt said Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been \u2018right\u2019 to express concern at the decision. \u2018I think she\u2019s right to do so and I think Boris is right to do so as well because I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious,\u2019 he said. Meanwhile Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and leading legal expert, said that although there was strong evidence that Lord Janner was suffering from dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. Earlier this week, leading politicians from seven parties came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute Lord Janner and demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. The cross-party group, led by Labour\u2019s Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times saying: \u2018As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.\u2019 Mrs Saunders announced last week that there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 crimes against nine victims but said it was not in the public interest to do so. Mrs Saunders\u2019 decision not to prosecute came after a two-year multi-million pound inquiry by Leicestershire Police examining allegations spanning four decades. It led to a furious public row with victims saying they will never see justice and police threatening a High Court legal challenge. Mrs Saunders defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular. But the Daily Mail can reveal Clare Montgomery QC offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Mayor of London Boris Johson, pictured, has expressed concern over the failure to charge Lord Janner . She told Mrs Saunders it was unlikely prosecutors would be \u2018susceptible\u2019 to a judicial review if she took Janner to court. Senior lawyers feared Janner\u2019s legal team, closely advised by his QC son Daniel, would try and block the case with a High Court challenge focusing on his ill health. But Mrs Montgomery is understood to have said that as long as prosecutors had the support of his alleged victims it was unlikely any such review would be successful. Eleanor Laws QC, who was leading counsel to the investigation, recommended that he be charged. Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. Mrs Saunders concluded that there was enough evidence to prosecute but Janner\u2019s ill health prevented any criminal proceedings. She appointed two of the country\u2019s foremost dementia experts who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve. They were Professor Michael Kopelman, of King\u2019s College London, and Dr Katherine Humphreys, of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. At least 10 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including six in the past year. Mrs Saunders has told friends that she has no intention of quitting over the Janner row. One said: \u2018She says she will not be hounded out of office. She is absolutely determined to stay in post.\u2019 In the coming months, she is due to rule on whether Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK should face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal which engulfed the News of the World. Scotland Yard detectives investigating alleged corporate crime are seeking to bring a case that would force senior executives to be held to account. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and said Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an \u2018ancillary matter\u2019. She said: \u2018It is the Director of Public Prosecution\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what she has done in this case. \u2018As the ultimate decision maker, she receives advice from a number of internal and external lawyers but the decision is based, ultimately, on her own assessment of the relevant law and circumstances of the case, no one else\u2019s.\u2019",

    "source": "Wayne Rooney knows Champions League qualification is Manchester United's to lose, making this weekend's clash with Aston Villa all the more important. Louis van Gaal's side sit fourth in the Barclays Premier League standings as the season enters the closing stages, boasting a five-point cushion over the chasing pack after winning so impressively at Liverpool before the international break. Juan Mata's brace earned United a deserved 2-1 triumph at Anfield to give them a buffer over the Reds, as well as fellow top-four contenders Southampton and Tottenham. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney feels the club are on course to qualify for the Champions League . United midfielder Juan Mata scored a fantastic brace against Liverpool to secure his side a 2-1 win at Anfield . The second of Mata's goals was a brilliant improvised scissor kick to give United a 2-0 lead in the second-half . However, Rooney is well aware how quickly things can change, admitting nothing less than victory will suffice when Aston Villa come to Aston Villa on Saturday. 'Yes it was (a six-pointer at Liverpool), but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday,' the United captain said. 'Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us. 'I think there are still eight games left. We are in a good position at the minute so it's in our own hands, so have to make sure we do it.' Rooney and several of his United team-mates only returned home from international duty on Wednesday afternoon after a technical fault on the England team plane delayed their departure from Turin. It meant an extra night in Italy, where it looked like they would be leaving after a night to forget as Graziano Pelle punished the Three Lions' poor first-half display. However, Andros Townsend's wonder strike saw England secure a 1-1 draw following a much-improved performance after half-time, when Roy Hodgson's bold substitutions paid off - as did his decision to partner Rooney with full debutant Harry Kane. The England skipper had spent the first half in midfield role as Hodgson tinkered with his side, although he is not allowing that experimentation to be an excuse. 'I think it's important in tournament football you might need that, so that's what we were doing,' the 29-year-old said. Rooney competes for the ball with Italy defender Andrea Ranocchia during Tuesday's international friendly . Rooney runs forward with the ball during the friendly match at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on Tuesday . 'We were trying a few different things out because you never know with injuries and suspensions in tournament football. The best time to do it is obviously in the friendlies. 'You could clearly see in the first half that it didn't work so I think the manager made good changes at the right time which helped us to get back into the game. 'Obviously I haven't played in midfield for a few weeks. Sometimes it is difficult to go from up front to midfield or from midfield to up front - sometimes it does take time. 'I had a few chances and could have scored, so I felt I played better when I went up front.' United team-mate Phil Jones was another to struggle away from his preferred position, looking lost at times at the base of the diamond. He looked more assured when he dropped back into defence after Chris Smalling complained of feeling unwell and was replaced by Michael Carrick late in the opening period. The 33-year-old had not played for England since October 2013 before these matches and Rooney loves having his club-mate around. 'I felt Michael Carrick was the best player on the pitch by a mile,' he said. 'He gave us great composure, he slowed the game down when we needed to and started our attacks really well.' Asked if Carrick has been under-rated throughout his career, Rooney said: 'Not from me and certainly not from Manchester United fans. 'I think he is a fantastic player. He has been a big reason why, at United, we have won so many trophies over the last few years. So from myself and his team-mates, he has not been under-estimated.' United and England midfielder Michael Carrick has been singled out for his strong performance against Italy .",

Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers, the\u00a0Gold Coast Bulletin reports. There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence. Tough new regulations will allow for a crackdown on notorious party houses on the Gold Coast after years of complaints about boozing and scantily-clad women . The new powers, approved by Deputy Premier and Planning Minister Jackie Trad, means there is now an official and legal definition of a party house so the council can enforce laws to shut them down in certain areas. If an illegal party house is reported to the council, authorities will be able to force the owner of the property to apply for a development application. If they refuse the council can legally shut them down. Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events like Bucks parties. Police have often been called in after neighbours complained about noise and lewd behaviour at some of the houses across the Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Mermaid Waters and Surfers Paradise areas. Gold Coast City Council will finally be able to shut down illegal party houses in suburban areas after the state government approved new planning powers . There are more than 700 party houses across the city, which are often used for unruly weekend-long parties that distress and terrify neighbours due to noise, nudity, lewd behaviour and violence . Some residents who live near a party house have said they are afraid to leave their homes while a weekend-long party is raging and are tormented by the noise and activities next door. Burleigh councillor Greg Betts told the Gold Coast Bulletin the crackdown would begin this month. 'This is a planning issue which means that the criteria of what is allowed to be a party house is strict and those people operating them will have to apply to have this status,' he said. 'If they fail to get this approval but continue to operate we can shut them down.' The former state government introduced new laws last year allowing council to institute 'party house restriction areas' where short-term rental properties will be forbidden from operating. Party houses are just short-term accommodation options that people regularly rent out for rowdy events like Bucks parties .

The 39-year-old Ukrainian, speaking to reporters ahead of Saturday's fight against American Bryant Jennings at New York's Madison Square Garden, has dominated the heavyweight division for nearly a decade and shown no signs of slowing down. 'As long as I have motivation and health, I'll do it. I don't feel old, or bad, or slow,' said Klitschko, who has 17 successful defenses in a row since winning the crown for the second time in 2006.

Klitschko (left) and Jennings (right) square up to one another at the press conference ahead of their fight . 'What could be cooler, or better, than to be the best man on the planet and beating up people for a living?' The 6-foot-6 Ukrainian boasts a 63-3-0 record heading into the bout against Jennings, who is 19-0 since taking up boxing six years ago. But the 30-year-old challenger from Philadelphia is not impressed by Klitschko's accomplishments and plans on starting a new reign. 'My first edge is youth. Youth is always an edge that you can't deny. Speed. Speed is an edge. These are things that are obvious,' said Jennings. And Jennings wasn't alone in trying to bring the Ukrainian down. Maverick heavyweight Shannon Briggs made an appearance at the press conference and taunted Klitschko while taking his shirt off. Despite a three-inch height advantage in Klitschko's favor, Jennings enjoys the same edge in reach, which could help him keep the champion at bay with jabs. Youthful exuberance may go only so far against Klitschko though, who has shown himself a master technician during his long run.

Former heavyweight Champion Shannon Briggs taunts\u00a0Klitschko during the press conference on Tuesday . Klitschko, who would also move within one of Larry Holmes's 19 consecutive title defenses with a win - second to the mark of 25 held by Joe Louis -said he was 'allergic' to comparisons with other greats. 'How long I've been champion, how many title defenses I've made ... I don't want to compare myself with any of the great heavyweights,' Klitschko, the 1996 Olympic champion said. 'I'm still looking up to those guys. They are still icons to me.' Jennings believes that age is on his side as he prepares to take on the experienced Klitschko on Saturday . Klitschko shows off his title belts ahead of the clash with Jennings at Madison Square Garden on Saturday . Should Klitschko conquer Jennings, other up-and-comers await including Britain's Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, who holds the WBC belt, the only one to elude the Ukrainian. 'I see the change of the generations is slowly coming, because I had all of those guys in my training camp coming up,' Klitschko said. 'They are very competitive, very young, very ambitious, very strong fighters that definitely are going to bring a lot of excitement in the ring.'",

    "source": "David Cameron likes to project an image as the 'chillaxing' statesman unruffled by political troubles - but this morning his usual demeanour seemed to desert him as he donned a bizarre outfit on the campaign trail. The Prime Minister looked  exhausted as he stepped off the sleeper train at Penzance today, ahead of a speech in which he delivered his 'plan for Cornwall'. The Conservatives are battling against their Coalition partners in the South-West as they seek to wrest control of key constituencies from the Liberal Democrats. But Mr Cameron is still trailing Ed Miliband's Labour Party nationally, with just 14 days to go until polling day. Get-up: David Cameron stepped off the sleeper train at Penzance this morning wearing jeans, smart shoes and a navy jacket . Journey: The Prime Minister travelled for eight hours from Paddington station to reach Cornwall . Tired out: The Tory leader did not appear to have enjoyed a good night's sleep on the train and was wearing an unusual combination of solely dark colours . A YouGov poll published this morning put Labour on 34 per cent - one point ahead of the Tories. The Lib Dems trail on 7 per cent with Ukip in third on 14 per cent. Mr Cameron said in an interview this week that he 'always manages to portray a calm smoothness' - however, he looked anything but smooth at Penzance station. The Prime Minister seemed as if he had had trouble sleeping on the eight-hour journey from London's Paddington station. His hair was unkempt and he was wearing an unusual combination of jeans with shiny loafers which might be considered more appropriate for a smart business suit. Destination: He apparently chose the sleeper to avoid taking time out of his schedule to travel . Outfit: Mr Cameron wore a navy jacket, dark blue shirt, jeans and smart black shoes - as well as a red box . Inspiration? Mr Cameron may have been trying to channel the style sense of US President Barack Obama . Mr Cameron sported a navy jacket with a dark blue polo shirt, and set off his outfit with the ultimate status symbol - a red box holding ministerial papers, which only a few dozen people are entitled to carry. While the jacket may have looked inoffensive, the Tory leader may have been making a political statement in support of the Union, as it appears to have been made by Scottish firm Lyle & Scott. Similar models retail online for around \u00a3125. Speaking at a factory later, he insisted that he had in fact slept very well - because his wife Samantha was not there to complain about him talking in his sleep. Mr Cameron said: 'It was very comfortable, very nice it was too, to have a night without the children waking me up or Mrs Cameron nudging me in the ribs and telling me to shut up for talking in my sleep.' In an interview with the Spectator published yesterday, Mr Cameron was asked why he has a reputation for lacking passion while on the campaign trail. Changed: The leader put on a more formal outfit for his speech at a company in Penzance . Gimmick: Mr Cameron tried out a selfie stick during a visit to radio station Pirate FM today . Snap: The Prime Minister used the gadget to take this photograph of himself with the station's staff . He replied: 'I don't know. There is something about me - I always manage to portray a calm smoothness or something.' But he went on to point to his hectic campaigning schedule - as shown by his decision to spend the night on the sleeper train in order to reduce his travel time in the day. While the overnight journey from London to Penzance lasts eight hours, Mr Cameron would have had to carve out five hours from his schedule if he had travelled to Cornwall in the daytime. There is also a 70-minute flight from Gatwick to Newquay Airport, not far from Penzance, but the Prime Minister may have calculated that taking the train is likely to project a more down-to-earth image. Fun: The Prime Minister took part in selfies with Tory activists during one of his Cornish campaign stops . Speech: Workers at the Rodda dairy factory in Redruth watch Mr Cameron address them . Back to business: In the afternoon the Prime Minister flew to Brussels for a summit on the ongoing Mediterranean migrant crisis . The constituency of St Ives, where Penzance is located, is the most remote in the UK because it also contains the Scilly Isles. It is typically the last area to declare its results after a General Election, due to the need to transport ballots from the islands to the mainland the morning after the vote. The seat is currently held by Lib Dem Andrew George, but the Tories will be keen to overturn his 1,719 majority as part of efforts to drive the party out of the South-West. In his speech at a scaffolding firm this morning, Mr Cameron told activists that Labour do not care about anything 'west of Bristol', adding: 'Now imagine what it would be like if Alex Salmond was calling the shots.' How the true blue PM takes refuge in navy outfits for work and play . The Prime Minister is known for his love of navy outfits - nearly all of his suits are dark blue, and he also sports the inoffensive colour when on holiday in Britain or abroad. He often resorts to navy polo shirts even while wearing casual attire such as shorts or flip-flops, having apparently calculated that the shade suits him and is unlikely to cause a political stir compared to more outlandish choices. On the campaign trail in recent weeks he has usually donned a navy suit - with the main exception being when he puts on high-viz jacket and hard hat for a visit to a factory. Favourite: Mr Cameron often wears navy blue when he is off duty, like in this photograph from his Cornish holiday in summer 2013 . Relaxed: The Prime Minister wore dark blue again while on holiday with wife Samantha in Portugal last year . Suit: Mr Cameron was wearing a dark jacket and trousers at a campaign event in Bedford yesterday . Superspy: David Cameron has backed William Hague to take over the role of James Bond . David Cameron has backed his Cabinet colleague William Hague to be the next James Bond - saying that it's time for Britain's most famous spy to be portrayed by a Yorkshireman. Speaking to Magic Radio's Nick Snaith, the Prime Minister was asked who he thought should take over from Daniel Craig when he gives up the role of 007. Mr Cameron replied: 'I'm a Sean Connery man so who is most like Sean Connery? Is it time for a Yorkshire James Bond? Is it time for William Hague to step forward? 'He's fit, he's healthy, he does yoga, he can probably crack a man's skull between his knee caps. I'd go for William Hague. 'You know we might have to sort out one or two things but I think he'd be good.' Mr Hague, the former Tory leader and Foreign Secretary, is set to have time on his hand after the Election because he is retiring from Government. Mr Cameron's rivals have previously weighed in on the Bond question - Ed Miliband said he thought Rosamund Pike should become the first female 007, while Nigel Farage proposed himself for the action role. In today's interview, the Prime Minister also confessed to his love of Game of Thrones, saying: 'I am a big Throny, I think it's great. I went to the set the other day. 'So I've stood on the wall. I've held Oath Keeper... Brienne of Tarth's sword. I was in Tyrion Lannister's bedroom. 'Well it's a bit like politics but actually, you know, you die even faster in Game of Thrones than you do in my chosen profession.'",

    "source": "The women who broke free from Cleveland's 'house of horrors' after a decade in captivity have revealed for the first time in their own words how they survived the traumatic ordeal. Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus recalled the years of rapes, torture and psychological games at the hands of Ariel Castro, a man who lived close to their homes in Ohio, and managed to lure them into his house with trust because his daughters were the girls' friends. The brave survivors have written a book,\u00a0Hope: A Memoir of Survival in Cleveland, which will be released on April 27. In an excerpt, published in\u00a0People magazine this week, Amanda and Gina, revealed how they found the strength to survive imprisonment. Scroll down for video . Amanda Berry, pictured following her escape from Ariel Castro's 'house of horrors' with her sister (left) and daughter (right) in 2013. The survivor has described in her new memoir, how her daughter gave her the strength to go on during the harrowing ten-year ordeal . Amanda Berry, 29, revealed in her first-person memoir about her abduction and imprisonment by Ariel Castro, that she was left confused by conflicted feelings towards him when he was kind to their daughter, whom she gave birth in captivity after being raped . Gina DeJesus, 25, also shared the details of her horrifying ordeal in a new memoir with Amanda Berry, being published later this week . Amanda recalled how she had learned from TV news that her mother died of a heart attack, aged 43, in March 2006, while she was 'chained like a dog' in Castro's home. At this point, the teen had been missing for three years. Castro lured her into his home on April 21, 2003, on a promise to see his daughter, her acquaintance. He barricaded the 16-year-old in a room, told her to pull down her pants and raped her. She was then chained in the basement and repeatedly abused. Four days after she was captured, Castro turned on the news and saw her mother pleading for her safe return. She said that a silent Castro watched Louwana Miller beg for her daughter to come home. 'He has an odd look on his face, and then I realize: He's proud,' Amanda wrote about her monstrous captor. She also described in the People interview how Castro was much stronger than he looked, packing muscle beneath his rotund figure. 'To be around him was scary,' Amanda recalled.'He had these cold black eyes. We were afraid we were going to die.' The Cleveland 'house of horrors' survivors have written a book, being published on April 27 . Gina DeJesus was abducted using a similar ploy by Castro a year later. She described her abductor to People as 'always prepared'. It later emerged that Michelle Knight, now 34, had been imprisoned in a separate bedroom since August 2002. A month after learning that her mother, Louwana Miller, had died, Amanda, realized she was pregnant by Castro in April 2006. Although initially elated, she worried how Castro would react. Amanda wrote: 'I think my mom sent me this baby. It's her way of giving me an angel. But I worry about what he's going to do. 'Michelle told me that he beat her to make her miscarry. Will he let me carry my baby?' As the pregnant teen mourned her mother alone amid harrowing torture and abuse, she recalled how she made video tapes of news reports of her mom at vigils and watched them repeatedly. Amanda wrote in the memoir: 'I would rewind and hear her voice. I feel like she's definitely here with me now.' On Christmas Day, she gave birth in her prison of a home to daughter, Jocelyn, with the help of Michelle. Castro appeared delighted to have a new daughter, Amanda wrote. She recalled: 'When the baby started kicking, I reached for his hand and placed it on my stomach. 'I knew the baby would be safer if he was excited about being a new father.' Castro told her that they were 'a family'. The predator took the little girl, whom he called Pretty, to church and out to play while her mother remained in chains in his filthy, dilapidated home. Castro finally took the chains off the three women when Jocelyn started to notice them, even though Amanda tried to protect her daughter by telling her that they were only bracelets. Amanda described her confusion at feeling some warmth towards Castro when he treated their daughter well. She wrote: 'I know it's wrong but I feel closer to him. I appreciate that he treats Jocelyn so well and buys her clothes and toys. 'I desperately want Jocelyn to have a normal life. On the days that he helps me do that, I actually feel some affection for him. I'm so confused. 'How can he be good one minute and so cruel the next?' When Jocelyn was five years old, Amanda set up a kindergarten in their bedroom. Amanda asked Castro to buy books. She recalled how her daughter would sit at her 'Dora' desk while Amanda, acting as teacher, would recite the Pledge of Allegiance with her. In November 2012, Castro was becoming more agitated. He lost his job as a bus driver due to stress and began to wonder how he would be remembered in the newspapers because of what he had done. His daughter Jocelyn began to ask when she could go to a real school. Amanda Berry (pictured left as a teen) along with Gina DeJesus (right) and Michelle Knight were held captive in Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio home for 10 years . The broken front door of the house on Seymour Avenue in Cleveland Ohio where Amanda Berry kicked her way to freedom on May 6, 2013, more than a decade after she went missing . On May 6, 2013, a chance finally arose - Castro forgot to lock the door of her bedroom, and Amanda grabbed her daughter and bolted for the front door, kicking her way out through a bottom panel. Amanda described that heart-pounding break for freedom in an exclusive interview with Robin Roberts for ABC's 20/20\u00a0to be aired next Tuesday. She said: 'I didn't know what to do, my heart immediately started pounding because I\u2019m like, ''is-- should I chance it? ... He could be here any minute, if I\u2019m going to do it, I need to do it now.' Following the daring escape, police descended on the home, freeing the other women and arresting Castro. He pleaded guilty in July 2013 to 937 counts including two charges of aggravated murder related to one act of forcing one of his victims to miscarry. The 53-year-old was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 1,000 years in August 2013.\u00a0He hanged himself in his prison cell less than a month into his sentence. Neither Gina nor Amanda is still in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight (pictured) but said in an interview that they wished her well for the future . Amanda recalls how mixed she felt when she learned from a text message that he killed himself. But despite being chained and raped for a decade by the monster, Jocelyn was his daughter and the little girl loved him. 'I don't know what to feel,' she wrote of that September night, as tears streamed down her face. Amanda and Gina revealed in their memoir, written with\u00a0Washington Post journalists Mary Jordan and Kevin Sullivan, how their captor would play mind games and try to turn them against each other. However they began to establish bonds as they struggled through their darkest hours. Neither Amanda or Gina is currently in touch with fellow survivor Michelle Knight. In People Magazine, Gina said: 'I think we all did like each other at one point but then [Ariel} played us against each other so we couldn't trust people.' Amanda added that the difficulty of their situation was something that only the three women could understand and she wished Michelle the best for the future. The mother said that she was focused on moving forward in life and concentrating on doing the best for her now eight-year-old daughter. Gina, who is studying for her high school diploma, dreams of owning her own business. And both women said what they have been through left them happy, simply for being able to have regular lives, surrounded by their families. In chains: Ariel Castro killed himself in prison in September 2013 after being sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for abducting the three women and holding them captive in his Ohio home .",

    "source": "Coach Leonardo Jardim believes Monaco's march to the Champions League quarter-finals is proof that clubs do not have to splash the cash in order to achieve European success. Four years have passed since Dmitry Rybolovlev's takeover prompted a slew of big-name arrivals at the Stade Louis II, with the likes of Radamel Falcao, James Rodriguez and Joao Moutinho signed for hefty transfer fees. But the Russian billionaire has tightened the purse strings in recent seasons and, with most of Monaco's expensive signings subsequently moving on, Jardim has been forced to nurture young talent after finding his options in the transfer market somewhat restricted. Leonardo Jardim addresses his players at training  ahead of Champions League match with Juventus . The Monaco coach insists he is proud after his side reached the quarter-finals without big investment . Big money signings James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao (right) have left the Stade Louis II . Monaco's new-found financial prudence is beginning to yield results, however, with Les Rouges et Blancs third in Ligue 1 and still in with a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals of European football's premier club competition for the first time in 11 years. The principality club host Juventus at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday looking to overturn a 1-0 deficit from the quarter-final first leg and Jardim, who replaced Claudio Ranieri last June, is proud of what he has achieved in his 10 months at the helm. 'We went from the worst qualified team in the fourth pot, to winning the group, to knocking out a European giant in Arsenal (in the last 16),' he told BeIN Sports' The Ligue 1 Show. 'Right now, you could say that Monaco's coach is very proud of his players. We've shown that we don't need to make big investments to go far in this competition. Dimitar Berbatov is convinced Monaco can reach Champions League semi-final at the expense of Juventus . Monaco are bidding to overturn a 1-0 deficit after defeat in the first leg in Turin last week . Monaco's Belgian midfielder Yannick Ferreira Carrasco arrives fro training . 'The club changed its strategy and the project (in the summer). They have stayed ambitious but the onus was placed more on the development of young players.' Jardim's young guns will have to be on top form if they are to advance to the semi-finals past a Juventus side 15 points clear at the top of the Serie A standings and well poised after Arturo Vidal's spot-kick winner in Turin last Tuesday. Juve are bidding to reach their first Champions League semi-final for 12 years and boss Massimiliano Allegri is taking nothing for granted ahead of Wednesday's encounter. 'The clean sheet at home gives us a slight advantage, even though it won't be straightforward,' he told his club's official website. 'We now know our opposition: they're very well organised in defence and possess technique and physicality in forward areas. Ricardo Carvalho (right), Elderson Echiejile (left) and Alain Traore arrive for training . The Monaco squad warm up for training with a light jog ahead of the quarter-final against Juventus . 'I'm optimistic, even though we know we'll have to put in a good performance and score to reach the next round. They're a complicated side to play against. Monaco don't give you an inch out there.'

    "source": "A heartbroken pensioner is believed to have killed himself six days after his wife's death by jumping from a bridge at their 'special place' where they used to take romantic walks together. John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain. His family feared the worst after discovering a note describing how much he missed his wife of 63 years and how he could not live without her. Double tragedy: John Lord, 86, went missing from his home on April 6 less than a week after his beloved wife June, 81, pictured together on their wedding anniversary, died from a 'catastrophic bleed' to the brain . Nottinghamshire Police launched an appeal in a bid to track down the grandfather-of-three on the day he disappeared from his home in St Ann's, Nottingham. Today officers confirmed a body pulled from the River Trent on April 15 by a specialist underwater search unit was sadly that of the missing pensioner. His family believe he may have killed himself at the picturesque beauty spot where the devoted couple enjoyed going for a walk. Message: Mr Lord's daughter Alison said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all' and described how he could not live without his wife . Mr Lord's last known moments were also captured on CCTV as he parked his white Toyota Yaris car near close to the Trent at 3.15am on April 6. The footage then shows the pensioner walking toward a bridge, which was the last sighting of him. His daughter, Alison Lord, 56, said her father was grieving and had left a heartbreaking note signed 'love to all.' Speaking before his death, the teaching assistant, who lives in Bulwell, Nottingham, added: 'He did leave a note. 'It said he couldn't live without June, and he apologised and said \"love to all\". 'It was completely out of character for him to get up and drive his car in the middle of the night.' Ms Lord said her parents, who were members of a local church, had been 'inseparable' and her mum's death had left the whole family devastated. A Nottinghamshire Police spokesperson said: 'The body of a man found in the River Trent on April 15, 2015, has been confirmed as that of missing John Lord. 'Mr Lord, 86, went missing from his home in St Ann's on Monday, 6 April. 'His body was recovered at around 11am on April 15 by Nottinghamshire Police's Underwater Search Unit.

    "source": "When it comes to playing tricks on people, especially parents it's important to know when to stop. However, this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager Lily Sharp, who lives in the UK, when she decided to prank her own mother. Rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door, Lily decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping- any parents worse fear. As mean-spirited as the joke appeared, Lily certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible. Scroll down for video . Lily Sharp perhaps took a joke too far after convincing her own mother she had been kidnapped . She began by texting her mother a seemingly innocent message: 'You didn't tell me the decorator man was coming mate!' Before adding in a quick reference from the famous Liam Neeson kidnapping film Taken. She continued: 'I thought I was guna get taken man. Thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house' (sic) before adding, 'Not happy young lady.' Lily began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home . She then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone, informing her mother that the kidnapper would require \u00a34000 for her return . Her suspicious mother replies immediately with: 'Whaaaat? What decorator?!?!! Call me. There is no decorator.' Lily then plays on her mother's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying: 'She knows that now.' At this point Lily's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately. 'Who knows it!! Call me please' she replies before adding, 'Now' After her mother reveals that she is sending the police round Lily reveals that it was all a trick . She convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself, her mother does not find it amusing . At this point many would have called their panicking parent however Lily decides to take it up a notch. 'My name is Victor' she replies before demanding a ransom 'I have your child. I want \u00a34000 to get her back.' Lily's mother tries to keep calm texting back: 'Sending a neighbour round now' But Lily simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies: 'Good luck with that. I've already gone. She's with me.' At this point Lily's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police: 'Ok well police will be.' Lily attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with 'She says hello' before revealing that it was all a trick. She then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa. Predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter. Although her mother may not have found the joke funny, after posting a photo of the messages on Twitter, Lily received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites.",

    "source": "An author has claimed that 'people are ready' for his forthcoming play which stars impressionist Alistair McGowan as the disgraced paedophile Jimmy Savile. Journalist Jonathan Maitland said while there had been some shock at the drama, An Audience with Jimmy Savile, the majority of critics are eager to know when they will be able to see it. It will open in London in June, less than three years since the late comedian's depraved behaviour was exposed in a television documentary. Scroll down for video . The author of a play which sees impressionist Alistair McGowan portray Jimmy Savile has said the public is ready for it to be shown . The revelation that Savile had abused dozens of children and young women in hospitals and schools throughout the 70s and 80s sparked an enormous Scotland Yard probe into other alleged abuse. Although some lines of inquiry are still ongoing, Maitland claims now is an appropriate time to thrust the subject into the arts. In an interview with The Guardian he said: 'It has changed everything; it has changed the way we look at abuse, it has changed the way we prosecute it, it has changed attitudes towards it, the way we treat the survivors of it. 'What person would not want to explore what kicked it off?' Drawing on interview transcripts and statements provided to the police by some of Savile's many victims, the play's central role has been given to impressionist Alistair McGowan. Most often recognised for his comedic performances, Maitland said his leading actor is also 'terrific' at embodying the 'dark, nasty' elements of the story. In his popular BBC series, The Big Impression, McGowan included Savile in a bizarre comedy sketch in which he portrayed American rapper Eminem. McGowan previously portrayed the comedian in his popular series The Big Impression. In a sketch he responds to a teenage Eminem's repeated requests to appear on Jim'll Fix It . Twitter users rejected Maitland's claim the public was 'ready' for the play, describing the subject choice as 'unbelievable' Dressed in a blue and white tracksuit similar to those worn by Savile, McGowan writes to the Jim'll Fix It host to ask whether he could appear on the programme with his mother to whom he is violent. Later he impersonates Savile himself, responding: 'It would be hard to let you hurt your mum on the TV, especially at tea time.' Sinisterly, he then tells the fictional teenage Eminem that the pair could go to Alton Towers 'in a few hours' before giggling and licking his lips. Author Jonathan Maitland said people were 'ready' for the play to be shown less than three years after the abuse was exposed . Before opening to the public the play will hear findings of the Dame Janet Smith's inquiry into abuse at the BBC. While Maitland said he will be happy to adjust any contentious parts to its liking, he is confident the public, and Savile's victims, will be prepared for the drama. 'Yes it will be strange to see someone doing him for the first time, but I think people are ready.' Critics have however slammed his 'unbelievable' subject choice. One Twitter user said it was 'not quite right' to portray the scandal, while another commented: 'Why not make Fritzl the musical?', referring to the Austrian predator Josef Fritzl who imprisoned his daughter for 24 years to carry out horrific sexual abuse. John Caswell refuted Maitland's claim that the public were ready, responding: 'It's official, I am not people'. But a lawyer acting on behalf of 178 of the comedian's victims said she had met with the playwright and was satisfied the play had been produced in good taste. 'From what Jonathan has told me it will be extremely sensitive and will not in anyway undermine the seriousness of the subject ,' said Liz Dux, specialist abuse lawyer at Slater & Gordon. 'After meeting with him and discussing the project at length , I'm satisfied he will not cause offence to any of the victims . In fact some have agreed to meet with him.' An Audience with Jimmy Savile is the author's second play. His first, Dead Sheep, is being shown at the Park Theatre.

    "source": "London (CNN)British police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of London's jewelry district said Friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but didn't respond. Southern Monitoring Alarm Company called the Metropolitan Police Service, also known as Scotland Yard, at 12:21 a.m. April 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd., MPS said in a prepared statement. \"The call was recorded and transferred to the police's CAD (computer-aided dispatch) system,\" the statement said. \"A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. This investigation is being carried out locally. \"It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.\" The theft was so big that police haven't come up with a value for what was stolen. Over the four-day Easter holiday, thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes. A former police official in London has speculated that the loss could run to \u00a3200 million, or $300 million, in a remark widely reported by news media. Numerous British news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the London Metropolitan Police Flying Squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost. The British tabloid The Daily Mirror claimed Friday to have obtained closed-circuit TV footage that captured the robbery being carried out. The video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered. They carried large bags, what looked like drill equipment and other tools, then exited with trash bins. Toward the end of the video, a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins. British police told CNN they have not released any video of the heist. When asked about the video published by the Daily Mirror, police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the Hatton Garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video. The Daily Mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days. The Mirror's time stamps, which CNN has not been able to independently verify, show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on Thursday. If the footage, and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct, at least six people were involved in the heist . Just four minutes later, the first of the thieves, nicknamed \"Mr. Ginger\" by the newspaper for his red hair, appears in the building holding a black bag. He goes downstairs toward the vault. At 9:27 p.m., a street camera shows a white Ford Transit van pulling up to an alley beside the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building. Men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away, leaving the men behind. Inside the building, at 9:30p.m., the camera records a thief nicknamed \"The Gent\" for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled \"Gas\" on the back. A minute later, \"Mr. Strong\" appears, wearing a builder's hat and carrying steel supports, which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault. At 9:36 p.m., Mr. Strong and a thief nicknamed Mr. Montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins, one of which might have contained, according the Mirror, the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault. It is unclear, but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault. At any rate, according to the Daily Mirror, no more activity is seen above ground until Friday morning, shortly before 8:00. The white van returns, is loaded in two minutes, and drives off again. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ginger returns, two days after he was first seen. The newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack. He goes downstairs toward the vault. Saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the Tall Man, who helped carry some of the loot out of the building. Early Sunday, Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and a robber nicknamed the Old Man are seen to be active. The Tall Man and the Old Man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside. The Old Man leans on the bin, struggling for breath, and reveals the side of his face to the camera. A white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it, including several trash bins. Three men get into the white van and, at 6:44 a.m. they are gone. The heist would not be reported to police for two more days, on Tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work. Police said Thursday there was no sign of forced entry. Johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building. The thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the United States -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement, he said. Once there, he said, they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were. People with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken. Some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend. Johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination. He said the floor was covered with dust and littered with safe deposit boxes and power tools. WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Johnson called the crime sophisticated and said there were a limited number of people in the United Kingdom capable of pulling it off. He said he had no idea whether the thieves were still in the country. Although there was no sign of forced entry to the building, the detective said, \"whether that involves inside knowledge will form part of the investigation.\" Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" How was $4.8 million in gold swiped from a North Carolina highway? The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\"",

    "source": "At first glance the rectangular island of Por-Bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison, with its regular structure and ruined sections. But it is unknown for certain what the rectangular island and its labyrinthine ruins, located in a lake in deepest Siberia, was actually used for when it was built 1,300 years ago. Historians and scientists are divided, but some experts believe the isolated area may have been built to attract people instead\u00a0imprisoning\u00a0them,\u00a0and suggest it was a summer palace, monastery, or an astronomical observatory. The mysterious island, Por-Bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern Siberia . A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined . The fortress is located\u00a0about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition . The name Por-Bajin translates as 'clay house' in the Tuvan language, and the island sits between the Sayan and Altai ranges, about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border. The location was first discovered in 1891, and the purpose of island has still not been explained over a century later. More in-depth research took place in 2007 with archaeologists discovering clay tablets of human feet, faded coloured drawings on the plaster of the walls, giant gates and fragments of burnt wood. Experts say the island was built during the period of the Uighur Khaganate (744-840 AD) but it is not clear what their motive would be for constructing a fortress for in such a solitary place \u2013 as it is far from big settlements and trade routes. Archaeologists conducted limited and inconclusive excavations at the site in the 1950s and 1960s . The ruined structures have led experts to believe the island was used as a fortress or prison . The island has baffled experts for over a hundred years who say it could have been anything from a prison, to a palace or monastry . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition. Scientists were able to use laser mapping to create a 3D image of what the 3.5 hectare plot could have been used for. Although it is said to be around 1,300 years old, many walls were intact and well preserved with a main structure in the inner courtyard being separated into two parts, covered by a tiled roof walkway supported by 36 wooden columns on stone bases. Isolated ruins! The fortress is connected to other land via a small walkway . Irina Arzhantseva of the Russian Academy of Sciences is now digging here for the Por-Bajin Cultural Foundation to find out just when the complex was built and why . Even more confusing than the debate of why it was created is the question of why it was abandoned. Researches have noted the lack of heating systems on the island, despite it enduring harsh Siberian weather and being located 7,545 feet above sea level. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the island with Prince Albert of Monaco in 2007 and echoed the confusion. 'I have been to many places, I have seen many things, but I have never seen anything of the kind,' he said. Por-Bajin ('clay House' in the Tuvan language) was long thought to be a fortress built by the Uighurs . The few artifacts unearthed at the site seem to date it to the mid-eighth century .

Graham told Cooper that she saw her son with a brick in his hand, and she lost control of her emotions and told him to drop it. Wednesday night: Across United States, protests in support of Baltimore demonstrators . \"I did (get emotional). You know, once he threw that rock down I said, 'You weren't brought up like this,' \" Graham said. He's not a perfect child, but he's also not a thug, she said. The 16-year-old boy said he understood that his mother was there looking out for him. \"She didn't want me to get in trouble (with the) law. She didn't want me to be like another Freddie Gray,\" he said, referring to the 25-year-old man who died of a severe spinal injury after being arrested by Baltimore police. Gray's death has sparked daily protests over police brutality. There have also been riots and looting that prompted the city to put a curfew into effect. Graham said her son told her the night before the violence at the mall that something was up. She told him then and the next morning not to go. He swore to her he wouldn't. Her motherly sense kicked in when she heard school had closed early and the mall was shutting down, too. She went to the mall and focused on the teens who were tossing rocks and bricks. There he was, in sweatpants she recognized. They made eye contact. He had a brick in his hand, and that set her off. Wednesday night: Marchers back in the streets of Baltimore . \"I was so angry with him that he had made a decision to do some harm to the police officers,\" she said. She yelled at him to put the brick down. Singleton said he had seen her, but it didn't make sense that his mother would be there. But when he heard her voice, he realized it really was his mom -- and he was in big trouble. Then the camera captured her memorable smackdown. \"It was just World War III from right there,\" he said, showing some humor about the incident. Graham noticed the TV crew but didn't think anything of it. And she didn't care. \"I wasn't there to be recorded. I was there to get my child,\" she said. Tameka Brown, one of Graham's five daughters, told CNN on Tuesday it wasn't that hard for her mom to spot her 16-year-old half-brother. \"She knows her son and picked him out. Even with the mask on, she knew,\" Brown said. Brown said her mother is always looking out for her children. \"She has always been tough and knows where we are at,\" Brown said. Graham said she tries to steer her son away from potential trouble and troublemakers. \"As long as I have breath in my body I will always try to do right by Michael and show him what's going on out in society doesn't have to be you,\" she told CNN. Her son said that once they got home from the mall he understood why she pulled him out of the crowd. \"I was embarrassed a little bit, until she just started talking to me when we got home,\" he said. \"(She was) just telling me she did it because she cared about me. And it wasn't to embarrass me, but because she cared.\" CNN's Elise Miller and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report. Watch Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 weeknights 8pm ET.

    "source": "(CNN)Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. \"The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,\" he said. \"It makes for the best cosmetic outcome.\" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. \"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',\" Dr. Green said. \"Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw.\" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. \"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'\" he said. \"If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. \"It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. \"You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!\" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. \"What's really fun is seeing it heal,\" he said. \"Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring.\" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. \"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,\" the company says. At \u20ac99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at \u20ac712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. \"If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,\" he said. \"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.\"",

A Saudi general said Saturday the nine-nation coalition has undertaken 1,200 airstrikes since they began on March 26. Gen. Ahmed Asiri added that the raids aim to keep the rebels from moving toward southern Yemen,  according to the SPA. Clashes took place Friday near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in the Najran region. Saudi forces responded to mortar rounds fired by Houthis on a Saudi border site. Three Saudi military officers were killed and two others were wounded in the shelling, a defense official said, according to SPA. A Saudi source also confirmed to CNN's Nic Robertson that three Saudi soldiers were killed in the shelling. The Yemeni Health Ministry on Saturday said 385 civilians have been killed and 342 others have been wounded. The World Health Organization has put higher figure on both tolls -- 648 killed and 2,191 wounded -- but includes militant casualties in the totals. Yemen has been descending into chaos in the weeks since Houthi rebels -- minority Shiites who have long complained of being marginalized in the majority Sunni country -- forced Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi from power in January. And even before the crisis escalated with the Saudi airstrikes, most of the 25 million people in Yemen required humanitarian assistance to meet their most basic needs, the United Nations said Friday.

His final request comes as images from Nusakambangan showed a haunting self portrait painted by Sukumaran in his cell, depicting the artist shot through the heart. His brother, Chinthu Sukumaran has pleaded with the Indonesian president to call off the firing squad while Sukumaran's lawyer was pictured removing the morbid paintings from the death row inmate's cell. Sukumaran's fellow death row inmate, Andrew Chan, has requested to spend his last hours in church with his family. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine member Myuran Sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self-portrait, showing a bullet through his heart . The painting is a self-portrait of Sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart . It comes after it was confirmed that Australians Andrew Chan and Sukumaran will be executed just after the stroke of midnight on Wednesday (3am AEST). The date - April 29 - became official when a local funeral director in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusakambangan, or Death Island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005. His skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Andrew Chan (left) and Myuran Sukumaran (right) have both been condemned to death on just past the stroke of midnight on Wednesday . Julian McMahon (pictured) the lawyer for the Bali Nine pair, removed the morbid paintings from Sukumaran's cell . McMahon looked downcast as he carried the paintings back from Death Island . Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. The talented artist's birthday in early April was marked in London where his cousin organised an exhibition of his paintings at the Amnesty International headquarters. The Bali Nine pair's lawyer Julian McMahon took four disturbing self portrait from Sukumaran's cell on Sunday, depicting the artist shot through the heart. The paintings were signed: 'Our new prison. A Bad Sleep Last Night', 'A strange day' and '72hrs Just Started'. Michael Chan (right), the brother of Andrew Chan and Chinthu Sukumaran (left), the brother of Myuran Sukumaran have pleaded once again for their clemency . Bali 9 duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran have been given notice of their execution, and could be killed by firing squad as early as Tuesday . A smiling Djoko Hariutomo, the police commissioner of the Balinese capital of Denpasar, poses for a photo with his hand on the shoulder of condemned prisoner Andrew Chan on a plane taking him to 'Death Island' They were dated April 24 and April 25. Chan and Sukumaran both refused to sign their execution warrants during official proceedings on Saturday, saying they believed it would be unjust to kill them. Chan and Sukumaran, convicted in 2005 for their role in a plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin from Bali to Australia, were given the official 72 hours notice on Saturday. 'He's found peace with what may happen but he and we all feel that this is a grave injustice and it did not have to be this way and it still doesn't have to be this way,'\u00a0Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters, after spending a couple of hours with his brother. Surrounded by armed police officers officers and on the road of no return, 33-year-old Australia Myuran Sukumaran looks up at Bali police commissioner Djoko Hariutomo who posed with the two condemned Australians before they were transported to\u00a0Nusakambangan island . It has been confirmed that the two men will be executed just past midnight on Wednesday . His mother Raji and sister Brintha also visited on Sunday, making the sad journey with Chan's mother Helen, brother Michael and fianc\u00e9e Feby Herewila and other friends. Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. 'Please, please show mercy,' he said. 'There are nine people with families that love them. Sukumaran painted the portraits in the hours before he and Andrew Chan were given execution notices . 'That's mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters. 'We ask the president to please use his powers to intervene and save their lives.' Mr Chan said his brother's only wish would be to go to church with his family in his last days. 'The two boys are still holding up pretty well considering they feel this is injust (unjust) to what has happened over the last ten years with their whole case,' he said. 'Somewhere in the legal system for Indonesia there's got to be mercy and the president needs to show that now. 'He's the only one that can stop it and it's not too late to do so.' It's reported only nine of the 10 prisoners Indonesia had readied for execution will face the firing squad, with Frenchman Serge Atlaoui granted a reprieve. Mr Atlaoui apparently won a reprieve based on an administrative matter. Mr McMahon carried Sukumaran's self-portraits away after showing them to reporters . The back of Sukumaran's morbid paintings read: 'self portrait' 72hrs just started' The paintings were signed by Sukumaran and dated . Sukumaran and Chan have been granted more time with family in their final days and will see them again on Monday. Lawyers are pleading with Jakarta to respect legal proceedings that several are still pursuing, while international pressure for mercy also grows. France has pledged to work with Australia to halt the executions, with Prime Minister Tony Abbott set to meet Francois Hollande on Monday. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been seeking urgent talks with her Indonesian counterpart since Friday. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyers have lodged a challenge with the constitutional court but the attorney-general doesn't acknowledge it, arguing the pair have exhausted their appeals. Andrew Chan has requested to spend his last days in church, while Myuran Sukumaran wishes to paint . Andrew Chan (pictured) has requested to spend his time in church ahead of his execution . The brothers looked sombre as they left the prison on Nusakambangan Island on Sunday . Chinthu Sukumaran said they asked Joko Widodo to show the same mercy he'd asked for his own citizens on death row overseas. Sukumaran began painting when he was in Kerobokan Prison in Bali . But his office is yet to respond to moves by lawyers for Filipina Mary Jane Veloso, who filed a second request for a judicial review late on Friday. Indonesia Zainal Abidin has an appeal before the courts due to be decided on Monday, but has been moved in preparation of execution as if the result is pre-determined. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has added his voice to global calls for Indonesia to halt its execution plans. 'The Secretary General urges President Joko Widodo to urgently consider declaring a moratorium on capital punishment in Indonesia, with a view toward abolition,' a spokesman for Ban said. Last ditch efforts to save the pair have also been launched by not-for-profit organisations, such as Amnesty International. His work was showcased at an exhibition in London on his birthday .

Thousands of flowers will be used to spell out the words KeepHopeAlive at a reserve overlooking Sydney Harbour in an appeal for Chan and Sukuraman. Amnesty International says the floral message will be displayed from Monday at Blues Point Reserve. 'Today in Indonesia, up to nine people - including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - face imminent execution in as little as 72 hours,' Amnesty said in a statement. 'More than 140 countries around the world have now abolished the death penalty for good. It's not too late for Indonesia to join them.' Members of the public are encouraged to contribute to the appeal by purchasing flowers from Amnesty's website. Brintha Sukumaran, the sister of Myuran Sukumaran, visits her brother ahead of his planned execution . The men's coffins are laid out in a holding area in Cilacap, before being transported to Death Island . The funeral director also ordered wooden crosses, pillows, satin covers and sets of cross-shaped coffin nails, individually bagged the way that furniture stores package their screws . Mr Putro shows the bill for the new coffins that arrived from Yogyakarta in the warehouse of Java Christian Church . Earlier, Australian embassy officials were called to Cilacap, the port town closest to Nusakambangan where the Bali Nine pair are now jailed, for a meeting about Indonesia's execution plans. 'I fear the worst,' Ms Bishop told reporters in Brussels. 'I fear that Indonesia will seek to proceed with the execution of the two Australian citizens. 'I am deeply and profoundly concerned by this.' Chan and Sukumaran, who were arrested over a heroin smuggling plot in 2005, can be executed 72 hours after being given notice, according to Indonesian law.",

But in one residential street, a local refuse collector has been exposed as a rogue litterer, dumping plastic bin bags in an alleyway. His antics were captured on CCTV installed by frustrated residents in Oldham, Manchester, who had noticed the rubbish piling up. Residents confused over who had been dumping bags full of rubbish in an alley next to their street were stunned when CCTV revealed a binman . Rather than load the bags into his lorry, the bin man was filmed lifting them out of dustbins along Park Road in Glodwick before tossing them down an alley. Another CCTV video shows council workers arriving in the same alleyway days later. They searched the contents of the bags before placing stickers on each of them warning residents they could face fines of up to \u00a350,000 for not having disposed of rubbish properly. It was captured on video installed by resident Zed Liaqat who, along with others on the street, thought one of their neighbours had been dumping the bags there. 'For at least a year now we have had an issue with rubbish bags\u00a0being dumped in the alleyway,' said Mr Liaqat. 'There is always a pile of them there, cars drive over them because it is\u00a0quite a busy passageway and the bags end up splitting and rubbish flies\u00a0everywhere. 'For all this time I, along with fellow residents, assumed it was one of\u00a0our neighbours and it has actually caused a bit of tension because we\u00a0thought someone was doing this on their own doorstep.' The footage showed the binman lifting the bags out o wheelie bins before throwing them to the side . Adnan Islam's father had been sent a letter by the council inviting him to a recorded interview over the issue before the CCTV was obtained . After watching the footage Mr Liaqat was shocked to discover it had been council workers that were fly-tipping all along. 'When I watched it I was gobsmacked, it was a binman. You would have never thought it would be the people who are supposed to\u00a0take the rubbish away. 'As a community we are shocked, something has to be done about this.' Some of the residents had been sent letters threatening legal action if the rubbish was not cleared up. Adnan Islam, who also lives on Park Road, revealed how his dad received such letter which invited him to a taped interview at Oldham Council Offices with a view to having the matter dealt with in magistrates' court. 'This has really worried my dad. The letter mentions court\u00a0and says he will be arrested if he doesn\u00b9t attend the interview,' said Mr Islam. 'After watching the video I have no doubt this is why my dad has been\u00a0accused. 'When I saw the video I was stunned. We take pride in our area so we want\u00a0answers.' Local councillor Arooj Shah said 'individuals' such as those shown in the video 'ruin it for everyone'. An Oldham Council spokesman said the issue was being dealt with 'extremely seriously'. 'Our staff\u00a0must also lead by example. We are taking this matter extremely seriously and investigating it. 'We\u00a0will not hesitate to take appropriate disciplinary action, where necessary,'\u00a0Helen Lockwood, Oldham Council\u00b9s executive director for co-operatives and\u00a0neighbourhoods, said. Oldham Council had slapped stickers on the bin bags because they were not properly disposed of. It said it was investigating the footage .",

Earlier this month club president Naoki Ogane claimed that the Blues have made an offer - believed to be around \u00a34million - for the  Japan international. Chelsea would look to loan Muto to partner club Vitesse Arnhem next season but the 22-year-old is keen to join a club where he will play regularly and realise his potential. FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto has a shot against Shonan Bellmare during a J-League clash . Chelsea have made an offer for Muto according to FC Tokyo president Naoki Ogane . Asked about a potential switch to London this summer after scoring the winner against Shonan Bellmare last week, Muto said:\u00a0'I want to think about it carefully. 'Where can I go to develop? A team that suits me, where I can play and develop. I'm thinking about that, and for now I just want to take my time and think it through.' Real Zaragoza boss Ranko Popovic gave Muto his debut for FC Tokyo in July 2013 and he believes the pacey forward could be a big hit at Stamford Bridge. Speaking to Bleacher Report, Popovic said: 'His potential was amazing, I didn't see for a long time such an intelligent player like Muto. He's a different guy, he's not such a usual player. 'Muto is something like a noble. He has something different to all other players because he comes from a good family, he has good education, he was at university. A very smart, intelligent guy. He has something which you cannot learn. 'He was so fast. So speedy and, for a Japanese guy, so strong. And also so confident. He has a lot of confidence. In our training games Muto always had chances. Amazing. He had 10 or 12 chances in every game.' Muto says he is still considering a move to Chelsea as he wants to join a club where he will 'play and develop' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had admitted that he is aware of the Japan international . Chelsea signed a \u00a3200million sponsorship deal with Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama Rubber in February and Jose Mourinho has admitted that commercial interests do play a part in the club's transfer policy. Asked about Muto earlier this month, Mourinho said:\u00a0'I know a little about him. I don't think it is nice for me to talk about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. 'If a FC Tokyo manager talks about my player I wouldn't be happy.It is not nice for me to speak about other players. 'In modern football and football is a business, an industry, you have to think about the financial situation, especially a club like Chelsea that wants to be in the rules like Financial Fair Play. 'But we want to win matches and don't get a player unless he is a good player or a good prospect.'",

A dog has been evicted from social housing for terrorising  postmen\u00a0- meaning neighbours can have their mail delivered for the first time since February 2014. Mother-of-two Hayley Sandiford has been told she must get rid of her seven-stone American bulldog Winston by the end of April or she will also have to leave her house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The pet has attacked several terrified postmen but Miss Sandiford says Royal Mail are victimising Winston and claims her family are being 'taunted all the time' by people in the area. Angry neighbours have even left notes on her front door saying 'keep your devil dog away', she says. One postman on his rounds reported Winston bounded 100 yards up the street towards him before clamping his powerful teeth around his mailbag. The victim had to cower behind a tree and throw his one remaining letter to distract the animal before diving behind a gate and alerting a colleague to take cover. A second postmen reported being being bitten on the arm and had to kick Winston in the head twice to fend him off. Winston's attacks have led to a 14 month ban on all postal deliveries to 60 homes in his neighbourhood. Residents living on two surrounding roads  have been making make a four-and-a-half mile round trips, sometimes by taxi, to collect their mail. Twin Valley Homes housing association has now taken Miss Sandiford, 30, to court and she must find a new home for the dog by 4pm on April 30 or her tenancy is at risk. Obsessed: Miss Sandiford admits her American bulldog has 'a thing' for chewing up mail - but unfortunately this has led to him also attacking postal staff . Legal battle: A housing association has decided to end a ban on postal deliveries to the area of Blackburn by demanding that Winston is evicted . The ruling at Preston County Court means the post to the area is due to resume on May 1. Today Miss Sandiford, who has asked a friend to take in Winston, said: 'I feel sick and gutted to be losing Winston. Winston had been brilliant and I have done everything they asked me to do but they're still making a big deal out of it. Court case: Miss Sandiford outside court last year after Winston was threatened with destruction for attacking a postie . 'I have had things stuck on my door saying keep my 'devil dog' away. I don't even like going out anymore I'm not the same kind of person. My kids have been affected at school through it because people would say stuff and my son gets into trouble because of that. We are being taunted all the time. 'Winston is one of the nicest dogs. He is not a danger - I wouldn't have him near my kids. 'Unfortunately he does have a thing about postmen but it is the mail they carry and not the postmen themselves. I don't get much post only bills and a lot of junk mail and he loves ripping them up. He doesn't touch the kids toys he'd rather play with the leaflets that come through the door. 'Winston did jump up at the postman - but he is a very bouncy playful little thing and he forgets how big he is - although I accept it must have been scary for the postman.' Winston's first trouble came in February last year after it bit an unnamed postman on the arm whilst being taken for a walk by his owner's nine-year-old son. The postman suffered a bite wound which broke his skin and he underwent medical treatment in hospital. Although postal deliveries were suspended no action was initially taken against the animal but at 10am on July 9 the 'thick set and stocky built' dog bounded up to postman Paul Warnock whilst he was on his rounds. Mr Warnock who had only delivered to only a handful of houses later told a court hearing: 'Straight away I was worried because it was quite a big dog. As soon as it spotted me it came running towards me fast, at speed. 'Then it was showing it's teeth and growling at me. It was coming at me aggressively, I was frightened. I was backing off then all of a sudden it went for me it grabbed the bundle of mail. It was in the middle of the street because I was backing off so much.' Mr Warnock ran behind a tree for cover and added: 'When I got behind the tree I saw a gate, I thought if I can get inside the gate it's safe. I was left with one letter. It was still going for me. I had one piece on mail, I threw it to take it's eye off me and ran behind the gate. It would have attacked me in the street.' Keen: Winston once ran 100 yards to get to a post bag and the postman only managed to dive into a garden because he tossed a letter into the middle of the road . 'When I got behind the gate the dog was roaming the street. I saw my colleague further up the street coming down, he heard the commotion. I shouted \"Get back get back, dog loose on the street!\".' His colleague took cover behind a gate and watched Miss Sandiford get hold of the dog. Last October Miss Sandiford pleaded guilty to being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control and was handed a six month community order with a six month supervision requirement. She was also told that whenever is taken out for walks, he must be muzzled and kept on a harness with two dog leads and has to be accompanied by a person over the age of 16. Miss Sandiford was also ordered to keep her home securely fenced, but now it appears she must part with Winston to keep her home. David King, one of Miss Sadiford's neighbours said: 'It's brilliant news if they are going to start up the deliveries again. We've waited a long time to get the mail back. My wife is disabled and having to go down to the depot every time we get a letter is hugely frustrating. It's also frustrating that it has taken so long for this to be sorted. Trevor Smith said: 'The Royal Mail could have handled this a lot better and sorted it sooner. I can't understand why they stopped delivering to so many houses anyway. I'm not happy about it. I'll believe the deliveries are restarting when I see it.' Ian Bell, head of Twin Valley Homes, said: 'We're delighted to get this result. The people in the area have suffered due to a lack of a postal service and being in fear of this dog for too long, but now they can see an end in sight. The Royal Mail confirmed a health and safety assessment had been carried out on Miss Sandiford's neighbourhood which highlighted an 'unacceptable level of risk associated with deliveries.' A spokesman said 'Suspending deliveries is a last resort but we take the health and safety of our employees very seriously. We apologise to all affected customers and we are pleased with this outcome.'",

    "source": "Teller Lake has become a giant fish bowl. The lake in Boulder, Colorado, has been invaded by thousands of gold fish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago. The animals have now multiplied to over 3,000 or 4,000, it's believed, and are threatening to over-run the natural species in the lake, by eating up all their resources and spreading unnatural diseases. 'Dumping your pets into a lake could bring diseases to native animals and plants as well as out-compete them for resources,'Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Invasion:\u00a0Lake Teller in Boulder has been invaded by 3,000 to 4,000 goldfish, which wildlife officials say started as someone dumping 'four or five' of their pets in the water two or three years ago . Overrun: Goldfish are not a native species in Colorado and are very harmful to the local aquatic ecosystem . Threat:\u00a0Fish that are native to the lake that are now being threatened by the invasive goldfish include channel catfish, blue gill fish and sun fish . In danger: Local officials are now considering two options - electroshocking the fish or draining the lake . Worried:\u00a0Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) spokeswoman Jennifer Churchill has warned people against dumping their pets into local environments, saying it can be incredibly dangerous . 'Everything can be affected. Non-native species can potentially wipe out the fishery as we've put it together.' Crews now face the arduous tasking of attempting to get rid of all the gold fish, but there are only two options. One is to drain the 12-acre lake completely, or use electrofishing, where the fish are stunned by an electrical current and removed while they are paralyzed. The latter is the most likely option. Problem: The consequences of introducing a foreign species is far-reaching, officials say . Scene: Teller Lake stretches about 12 acres in Boulder, Colorado . An electrical current is put in the water in sections and the stunning brings the fish to the surface. It was a successful method used in November 2012 at Thunderbird Lake, also in Boulder, to remove koi goldfish from the water that had been improperly introduced. Some 2,275 fish were removed in the process. 'Most people don't realize the far-reaching effects of introducing exotic species to the environment,' Ken Kehmeier, senior aquatic biologist for CPW, told The Denver Chanel. 'Nonnative species can be devastating to native populations by causing disease outbreaks and creating competition unbalance. Removal: In November 2012, over 2,000 koi goldfish were removed from the nearby\u00a0Thunderbird Lake by 'electrofishing', where the fish are shocked with an electric current and paralyzed, causing them to float . Effective: With electroshocking, crews go out in a boat and stun the fish to paralyze and then collect them . 'It's an issue that anyone concerned with our environment should know about.' Despite the amount of fish in the lake, officials have warned locals against retrieving some of the fish and taking them home as pets. The gold fish will likely end up at a local raptor rehabilitation program as food. 'We don't have a timeline yet for when we're going to do that,' Churchill said.",

    "source": "Has this brilliant 79th Masters got one final twist to reveal come the final round on Sunday? No-one would be surprised following the dramatic events of the third round, when the three biggest names in the sport combined with Justin Rose to throw the veritable kitchen sink at the cool 21 year old Texan Jordan Spieth. The young American coped so adeptly he gave up just one shot of his five stroke halfway lead and will partner Rose in the final round armed with a useful advantage. But there was just enough vulnerability shown in his finish to offer encouragement not only to Rose but Masters specialist Phil Mickelson, who will start five behind. Spieth is the third player his age to take a healthy lead into the final round. It worked out perfectly for Tiger Woods in 1997 but not so well for Rory McIlroy in 2011, who collapsed under the pressure over the final nine holes. \u2018I think Jordan will cope better than I did because he was in the final group last year,\u2019 said McIlroy. \u2018I certainly expect him to cope a lot better than I did.\u2019 Jordan Spieth carded a double bogey on the 17th but still set a new 54-hole scoring record at the Masters . At 16 under par, Spieth broke the record shared by Ray Floyd and Tiger Woods by a single shot . The other thing Spieth has in his favour is that this is the fourth tournament in a row when he has been in the final group in the final round. He won one and finished runner-up in the other two. If he wins, he will go to number two in the world and the rivalry with Rory that might dominate golf for the next decade will have begun. Spieth looked to have taken the tournament beyond everyone else when he went seven strokes clear with just two holes to play. But while Rose finished off with a staggering fifth birdie in his last six holes, Spieth was running up his first double bogey of the tournament at the 17th. And at the last there was a horrible fanned approach that threatened to trim the lead to just three, before Spieth conjured up a remarkable up and down to give him momentum heading into what promises to be another momentous Masters Sunday. Plucky journeyman Charley Hoffman lies fourth while Woods and McIlroy both shot 68 to be tied fifth and will play together on Sunday. But at ten shots off the pace they are surely too far behind. As for Rose, the 2013 US Open champion has given himself the chance of seizing another major following his astonishing finish. Pick of the quintet of birdies came at the par three 16th, where he holed a spectacular bunker shot. \u2018I think it\u2019s important to be in the final group, it\u2019s where you want to be,\u2019 said the 34 year old Englishman. \u2018Jordan is obviously playing some very special golf but I have definitely given myself an opportunity.\u2019 World No 1 Rory McIlroy and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods were in a five-way tie for fifth . Finally, the real McIlroy showed upon the par fives at Augusta on Saturday . What a day we had on Saturday. It was as if Rose and the big three in terms of charisma had come up with an unspoken pact and declared: \u2018Ok, let\u2019s see if this kid Jordan is really destined for greatness.\u2019 For those who thought the runaway halfway leader had merely to turn up to claim the green jacket, we had McIlroy playing like the world number one and Tiger confounding the sceptics with a bravura display that made you feel the last 12 months had all been a bad dream. There was the glorious sight of Mickelson playing once more like he owns Augusta. And then there was Rose, who has had a lot of good days at Augusta in his ten Masters tournaments and now was enjoying one more. How would you like to see all that taking place in your rear view mirror, at this of all courses? In short, for five simply incredible hours the roars were echoing all over this sacred property and for most of that time they were funnelling in Spieth\u2019s direction. This was undoubtedly as severe an examination as you could imagine for a third round. Just as well, then, that the creed that has served him so well already during his phenomenal 18 months as a professional just happens to be: \u2019Whenever the heat is on, ensure you focus just that little bit more.\u2019 And that, for the most part, is just what he did. Only at the end did he look like stumbling, but that fabulous up and down at the last kept everything upbeat. Tiger Woods put on a vintage show, he was\u00a0astonishing, electric, inspired and charismatic . Woods' girlfriend Lindsey Vonn showed her support during the third round on Saturday . The previous 54 hole standard of 15 under was set by Ray Floyd in 1976 and Woods in 1997. But the youngest first round leader in Masters history and the man who set a new low mark for 36 holes on Friday had reached 16 under after a 70. What made this so impressive was that, for the first time, a few errors crept into his previously immaculate game. During the round he would have three three putts and his first double. When things like this happen here it\u2019s so easy for the mind to unravel but Spieth kept his composure. At the par five second that peerless putting stroke rapped home another birdie putt and one more at the sixth. At the treacherous 9th he seemed to have left himself a difficult second shot, from a downhill lie to an elevated green. Spieth knocked his approach to 6ft and holed that one as well to turn in 35 shots. In its own way, this was the equal of his spectacular bouts of scoring in the first two rounds. So it continued. The two stringent par fours to start the back nine were safely negotiated before his tee shot to the par three 12th came down 8ft from the flag. You can guess what happened next, and he birdied the 13th as well. He would threeputt the 14th, however \u2013 and then came the next test. Phil Mickelson played like the Masters specialist to finish the third round on 11 under . Justin Rose reeled off five birdies in the last six holes to move into second place on 12 under . As he made his way down the 15th fairway, first Mickelson and then Rose made amazing birdies at the 16th to send the crowd into raptures. How would he respond? Well, at the 15th he calmly stroked a four iron into the middle of the green for a two putt birdie. Best of all was the eight iron he struck to 8ft at the 16th for yet another birdie. McIlroy, Woods and Mickelson all shot sumptuous front nines of 32 shots. Mickelson was wearing a salmon pink shirt in honour of Arnold Palmer. Some of his great attacking play had been delivered wearing just such a colour and Mickelson was doing justice to the memory. Eight strokes off the pace at the start of play, he\u2019s still in the ball game but will need another magic-filled round today. Add McIlroy\u2019s wonderful back nine 31 from Friday afternoon to his front nine 32 yesterday, and you would have a round that equalled the course record of 63. Amazing how the switch flipped for him at the halfway point in the second round. So tentative to that point and perhaps a touch nervous with all that was at stake, it was as if he looked at a leaderboard that showed him 17 shots off the lead and a stroke outside the projected halfway cut and decided: \u2018To hell with it, let\u2019s go for it.\u2019 Finally, the real McIlroy showed up on the par fives, those scoring holes that have given him such problems in recent years. An eagle at the 13th on Friday was followed by an eagle on the second in his third round. He was off and running. He birdied the long 8th plus the 13th and 15th for his best-ever return on the par fives during a single round at the Masters. A poor eight iron to the 16th cost him, however, as a 6ft par putt was dribbled miserably. Another bogey at the last as well meant a 68. And so the likely list of winners stands at just three \u2013 Spieth, Rose and Mickelson. It should be some final day. It has been some tournament.",

The Premier League champions want to reshape their squad this summer after a disappointing season and they could look to offload the 31-year-old, who has struggled to hit top form. Toure, who is wanted by his former manager Roberto Mancini, appears open to a move away from the Etihad if the right opportunity presents itself at the end of the season. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has hinted that he is open to leaving Manchester City this summer . Toure is challenged by West Ham's Mark Noble during City's 2-0 win at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon . Toure celebrates with Sergio Aguero and Jesus Navas after the Argentine's goal against West Ham . Speaking to Foot Mercato, he said: 'No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me. 'It would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don't stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. 'For the future, I don't know more than you do, because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature. 'When I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight until the end of my career at this club. 'My decisions will not be affected by changes in management, but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.' City find themselves fourth in the Premier League table after a dismal run of form and out of the Champions League after a two-legged defeat by Barcelona at the last 16 stage. Inter Milan boss Roberto Mancini wants to be reunited with Toure next season after managing him at City . Toure's form has been disappointing this season and City are likely to try and sell him this summer . Whether Manuel Pellegrini remains manager or is sacked this summer will not affect Toure's decision . Some of Toure's performances have been heavily criticised but the Ivorian remains defiant. 'When things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,' he added. 'I am not the only one to have been attacked even if there is tendency to be harsher with me. Football is my passion, my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as I can.'",

    "source": "For all the problems that David Moyes had during his year at Manchester United, you wouldn't associate his teams with defensive frailties and a lack of organisation at set pieces. And since taking over at Real Sociedad Moyes has enhanced his reputation as a manager who brings, if nothing else, solidity. In his 21 La Liga games to date Sociedad have conceded just 29 times, climbing from the relegation when Moyes took over, to an extremely comfortable tenth place. Mikel Gonzalez diverts a corner past his own goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who fails to punch it away . Atletico Madrid celebrate after going two goals ahead after just 10 minutes, killing the match as a contest . Antoine Griezmann (left) is congratulated by Fernando Torres, but didn't celebrate against his former club . Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Gimenez, Miranda, Siqueira, Gamez; Suarez, Tiago, Koke, Turan (Niguez 81 mins); Griezmann (Gabi 90), Torres (Jimenez 61) Subs not used:\u00a0Ansaldi, Bernabe, Cani, Hernandez . Goals: Gonzalez (OG) 2, Griezmann 10 . Booked: Turan . Real Sociedad: Rulli; Gonzalez, Elustondo, Yuri, Zadldua; Bergara, Ruben Pardo; Zurutuza (Finnbogason 74), Canales (Agirretxe 74), Xabi Prieto; Castro (Granero 81) Subs not used: Martinez, Hervias, Estrada, Zubikarai . Yet, on Tuesday night, Sociedad showed none of the qualities usually associated with their manager, capitulating inside 10 minutes against the Spanish champions. By the time Antoine Griezmann struck the hosts' second goal, lifting the ball over the hapless Geronimo Rulli after the keeper had parried Koke's shot straight to the Frenchman, Atletico could have been four up, and the game was all but over. Arda Turan had already seen his volley hit the post after being left totally unmarked from a free kick, before Mikel Gonzalez diverted the resulting corner past his own keeper after little more than 90 seconds. Soon after Griezmann narrowly failed to connect with a header after yet more shocking set-piece defending, and the former Sociedad man also came close to tricking his way through the visiting defence, only to be denied by a last-ditch tackle. David Moyes looks on as his team showed uncharacteristic defensive frailties at the Vicente Calderon . Mario Suarez holds off Sociedad forward Sergio Canales as Atletico took control and never relinquished it . Atletico Madrid's Turkish star Arda Turan, who struck the post early on, takes of Gorka Elustondo . Against a team who hadn't conceded a single goal in their previous four games, it was suicidal. In response Moyes' side produced next to nothing. Chory Castro brought a save from Atletico's Slovenia keeper Jan Oblak which was comfortable enough, while Sergio Canales swung a leg at a dropping ball from inside the area, only to see it fly well wide. That was about all they managed until a free kick from one-time QPR midfielder Estaban Granero forced Oblak into his first stretching save with three minutes to play. The champions, on the other hand, without looking particularly good, continued to threaten, helped repeatedly by Rulli and his defenders, who seemed desperate to offer chances out of nothing. Mario Suarez was given the freedom of the penalty area from another corner, but couldn't make contact with his volley, before Rulli misjudged a wayward Koke cross, allowing it to land on his crossbar. Torres worked hard and offered a foil for the talented Griezmann before being replaced after an hour . Diego Simeone calls for more for his team as they kept their La Liga title defense alive . The Argentine stopper also flapped at a cross, allowing Guilherme Siqueira an opportunity from close range, but the full-back saw his shot deflected wide. The win means Atletico are only two points behind city rivals and Champions League quarter-final opponents Real Madrid, although Carlo Ancelotti's side have a game in hand, and the defence of their title is not yet over. Diego Simeone was able to rest Fernando Torres for the final 30 minutes, after the former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had run hard, without much success, alongside Griezmann. His side's season will be defined in the coming weeks, while Moyes' early successes in Sociedad means Real's campaign has already reached a successful conclusion, with survival assured. But his side's defending will nonetheless have hurt the former Manchester United manager.",

Pension firms said Britons remained baffled about how the radical changes worked, with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications. Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. And yesterday, the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money. Scroll down for video . Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings \u2013 unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can\u00a0cash in their pensions and spend them \u00a0instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image) David Trenner, of Intelligent Pensions, said it was 'crazy to stop advertising Pension Wise under Purdah rules', while Catriona Standingford, who runs a financial training firm, asked on Twitter: Shouldn't the consumer/taxpayer come first?.' The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone. But several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash, including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could 'get hold of their pot now'. Richard Parkin, of Fidelity, said: 'Misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds. 'Since the new freedoms were announced, we've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules.'",

The Argentine scored his 33rd league goal of the season against Almeria and with Marc Bartra heading in either side of two Luis Suarez goals - the first of which was almost a match for Messi's strike - Barcelona ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Messi's opener was one of those fantasy football goals that have become so common place they are now being taken for granted.

The Barcelona No 10 loses his markers in the Almeria penalty area before finishing with a trademark curled strike .

Subs: Ruben, Jurado, Azeez, Hemed . Booke: Casado . Some grumbled that Almeria\u2019s defence could have done more as he ambled in from the right touchline and sent his shot past Juli\u00e1n Cuesta in the visitors\u2019 goal. Other defences might have gone chasing the Bar\u00e7a number 10 and been left on the seats of their shorts, Almeria\u2019s rearguard tried to hold a line just in front of the six-yard box but Messi\u2019s left foot shot whipped past them and bulged the back of Cuesta\u2019s net. Not to be outdone, Suarez first goal of the night was similar drifting in from the right on to a Dani Alves pass and finding Cuesta\u2019s top right-hand corner just as his team-mate had before the break. Defender Bartra added a third and Suarez scored his second with the last kick of the game as Barcelona stayed clear at the top with now just eight matches to play. Suarez deserved his second half goals having been the brightest light for the home side early on. When a Rakitic through-ball put him in he should have scored. Perhaps surprised by the fact that the flag had not been raised his shot was smothered by Cuesta. Almeria were playing their first game under the management of Sergi Barjuan who played over 400 games for Bar\u00e7a and coached in their youth academy when his opposite number Luis Enrique was in charger of the B-team. They almost scored with a Wellington Silva cross-shot that just crept past Claudio Bravo\u2019s far post after Pedro got a touch to it. They were breaking quickly with the pace of former West Brom loanee Thievy Bifouma always a threat. Barcelona responded with Sergio Roberto finding Messi in space on the right but after he accelerated into the area he gave possession away with an uncharacteristically heavy touch. Pedro wrapped a cross-shot just wide of Cuesta\u2019s goal but still there was no breakthrough. It should have come on 24 minutes.

Barcelona were without Neymar, resting on the bench alongside Gerard Pique, but Messi, Suarez and Pedro should have linked to score on 24 minutes. Messi weaved in from the right flank, Suarez got the better of Angel Trujillo and pulled the ball back across the face of the six-yard box but Pedro failed to anticipate the pass and it ran to safety. It looked as if Barcelona would reach half-time without the breakthrough then Messi broke through and Almeria\u2019s resistance was broken for good. Thievy raced away and Mascherano risked a straight red by barging him off the ball as he looked like leaving the Argentine and the covering Sergi Roberto behind. He was shown a yellow and Almeria wasted the free-kick but they offered little going forward after the break. When Suarez scored 10 minutes into the second half only Barcelona\u2019s unwillingness to go up through the gears kept the score down. Bartra headed in goal number three with what was Barcelona\u2019s 14th set-piece goal of the season before Suarez made it four. With set-piece strikes Coach Luis Enrique and his assistant Juan Carlos Unzue have managed to add a new weapon to the Barcelona armoury.

    "source": "A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces.\u00a0The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits -\u00a0are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats . A masked fighter in black (right) brandishing a pistol vows to kill Christians if they do not convert, saying: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again' The victims are forced to kneel in front of the militants (above) before being shot at point-blank range simultaneously. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group . The militant in black - who is completely covered apart from his eyes - remains flanked by two people holding guns throughout the clip . Ethiopia is a predominantly Christian country with the religion being introduced in the country the 4th century, making it\u00a0one of the oldest Christian states in the world. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the oldest organized Christian bodies in the world, and more than 40 per cent of the population are members of the church. Around 20 per cent of the population follow other branches of Christianity, a majority being Protestant. Islam was not introduced in the country for another 300 years, and now about one third of Ethiopians identify as Muslim. Initial reports did not make clear who the captives were or when they were captured. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group. Redwan Hussein, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said officials were in contact with its embassy in Cairo to verify the video's authenticity. He said he believed those killed were likely to have been Ethiopian migrants hoping to reach Europe. Libya has become a hub for migrants across Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe for work and better lives. 'If this is confirmed, it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to Europe though the dangerous route,' Mr Hussein said. He added that Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Libya, would help repatriate Ethiopians if they wanted to leave.\u00a0Libyan officials were not immediately available for comment. Abba Kaletsidk Mulugeta, an official with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church's Patriarchate Office, said he also believed the victims  were likely to have been migrants. 'I believe this is just another case of the IS group killing Christians in the name of Islam. Our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith-based violence that is totally unacceptable. This is outrageous,' he said. 'No religion orders the killing of other people, even people from another religion.' Ethiopia's options to retaliate remain slim, given its distance from Libya. However, Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt Mohammed Edrees said his country could partner with Cairo to strike the militants. 'That could be an option,' Mr Edrees said. 'We will see and explore what is possible to deal with group.' It comes just two months after the extremist group in Libya beheaded 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a beach (above) The latest video mirrored a film released in February showing militants beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach (pictured above), which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya . Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate for the Middle East Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: 'The Islamic State in Libya is still focused on this consolidation phase of announcing its presence through these very high-profile executions. But they face some structural limits in terms of how much local support they can get because they haven't captured real revenue streams.' It comes just two months after IS militants  filmed themselves beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a similar beach, which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya. ISIS has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya, where two governments backed by rival alliances of militias are battling each other as well as extremist groups. The group is also advancing in Iraq, where it has captured three villages near the city of Ramadi. Islamic State fighters, pictured carrying flags and dressed in black, have been able to gain a foothold amid the chaos in Libya . More than 90,000 people have fled the ISIS's advance in Anbar, a United Nations humanitarian agency said earlier this morning. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that civilians are fleeing Ramadi as well as the three nearby villages captured by the IS group a few days ago. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said: 'Our top priority is delivering life-saving assistance to people who are fleeing - food, water and shelter are highest on the list of priorities.' Iraqi officials in Anbar have described Ramadi as a ghost town, with empty streets and closed shops. Iraqi troops backed by Shiite militias and U.S.-led airstrikes managed to dislodge ISIS, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East, from the northern city of Tikrit earlier this month. But the troops have struggled against the militants in Anbar, which saw some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S. military intervention that ended in 2011. Elsewhere today, the US-led\u00a0coalition said Kurdish forces recaptured 11 villages in Iraq's Kirkuk province from ISIS following days of intense clashes. The coalition said the area of about 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) was south of the city of Kirkuk.",

This clash was the last in a pulsating evening in Manchester dubbed 'Judgement Night' with five of the 10 players all facing the threat of elimination. Going into his match against Anderson, Van Barneveld knew he needed a positive result to keep his Premier League hopes alive following Adrian Lewis' 7-4 win over Peter Wright earlier. And the Dutchman duly delivered by taking a 5-3 lead against the Scot, which ensured he earned at least a point, before drawing 6-6. That draw, coupled with Lewis' win, meant that Wright was one of two players to be eliminated from this year's tournament - and cruelly so via leg difference.

    "source": "Harry Kane hailed an unforgettable week after taking his England bow and becoming the youngest captain in the Premier League this season - but he will want to erase the memory of Tottenham's goalless draw at Burnley. Kane, 21, was chosen as Spurs captain after a week which has also seen him score on his England debut and make his first start for the national team. It was a frustrating end to the week for Kane however as Spurs struggled to make an impact against a hard-working Burnley side who earned a precious point in their battle to avoid relegation. Harry Kane has hailed his trailblazing few days as the \u2018best week of my life\u2019 after captaining Tottenham . That came after he scored within seconds of his England debut against Lithuania on March 27 at Wembley . Kane said: 'You could say it has been the best week of my life - to score, to make my first start and score for England, and to be captain today. It has been an unbelievable couple of weeks and one I won't forget for the rest of my career.' Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino admitted a top-four place may be beyond his side as they are seven points off fourth-placed Manchester City - who play Crystal Palace on Monday night - with a vastly inferior goal difference. Pochettino said: 'It is difficult but we have seven games, we will try. It is true that it is not easy. This game was a very tough game and we need to try to win the most points possible in the next seven games. 'The way Burnley play it is difficult, because always there is long balls into the box. They are a very aggressive team and run a lot. It is difficult to find space to play. 'We played better in the second half and we made some chances but it was not enough to score. Three weeks ago Manchester City lost here. It is not an excuse but it is a very, very difficult team.' Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettino still believes they can catch Manchester City and finish fourth . The goalless draw at Burnley left Tottenham down in sixth, some seven points adrift of Man City . At just 21 years and 251 days, the Tottenham striker led out his side for the first time in draw with Burnley . Kane could not find a way to break the deadlock for Tottenham in their 0-0 draw at Turf Moor on Sunday . Pochettino confirmed Kyle Walker, who limped off, has a sprain but said it was 'not a big issue'. Burnley manager Sean Dyche claimed the Clarets had the better of the match and rued a gilt-edged chance missed by Danny Ings, who shot straight at Michel Vorm when it seemed easier to score. He said: 'I think we edged the game, but there was not a lot in it. 'We kept the tempo high and kept pressing high. Danny has had a great chance and it was unlike him not to put it away, he almost hit it too cleanly. 'Having said that we are pleased to get another clean sheet against a top side.' Dyche picked out Ashley Barnes for special praise but said the whole of his team had performed well against a Spurs side boasting four England players. The Burnley boss also said he was not too concerned by their struggles to find the net - they have only scored once in five games. He added: 'I prefer to look at it as two clean sheets in the last three games against some fantastic sides.' Kane (left) watches his header find the net against Lithuania and it earned him a start against Italy . Sean Dyche believed Burnley might have taken all three points from the match .

Alena struggled to describe the situation to the child and told the 12-year-old that her father 'loves his country.' Alena and Hughes have been married for thirteen years, After meeting online, the two went on a few dates in Moscow and St. Petersburg in Russia. Alena moved to the U.S. in 2002 and the two got married. Alena said she knew that Doug was interested in politics but had no idea of his risky plan when he bought the gyrocopter two years ago. She told WFLA that she was sure Hughes wasn't doing anything wrong.

Alena said her husband had his own lawyer in Washington, but she has hired an attorney, Paul Carr, in Florida to represent her. 'After discussing the situation with her, I didn't see any criminal intent,' Carr said. 'In fact, there's a lot of people that would like to approach Congress.' Hughes' stunt raised security concerns as lawmakers said the incident exposed a security gap. The concerns were raised further amid revelations that Hughes was interviewed by the Secret Service almost two years ago and revealed his plan for the stunt to both the Tampa Bay Times -- which has recently come under fire for failing to stop the stunt -- and in a 2013 blog post.",

    "source": "Washington (CNN)Nearly 6 in 10 Americans say that businesses that provide wedding-related services should be required to provide those services to same-sex couples in the same way they would all other customers, even if they have religious objections. A new CNN/ORC poll finds 57% feel businesses such as caterers or florists should be required to serve gay or lesbian couples just as they would heterosexual couples, while 41% say they should be allowed to refuse service for religious reasons. That's a shift from a Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall, which found just 49% thought businesses ought to be required to serve same-sex couples while 47% that they should be allowed to refuse service on religious grounds. Since the Pew poll last fall, Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed into law in late March by Republican governor Mike Pence, sparked a nationwide controversy over whether the law allowed wedding-related businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian couples. Apple, Walmart and the NCAA all spoke out against the law, while some states and cities with Democratic leaders barred spending public money in Indiana. Pence and other Indiana legislators insisted discrimination was not the law's intent and a bill to change the original law was signed in early April. In the CNN/ORC Poll, most Democrats (70%) and independents (60%) say wedding-related businesses should be required to provide services to same-sex couples as they would different-sex couples, while Republicans break broadly the other way, 67% say religious reasons are a valid justification for refusing service. Full poll results . Looking at Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party, 60% in that group say wedding-related businesses should be allowed to refuse services to same-sex couples, but there are sharp divides within that group by age and ideology. Moderate and liberal Republicans and Republican-leaners broadly say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve all couples the same way (58%) while three-quarters of conservative Republicans favor allowing a caterer or florist to refuse service for religious reasons (74%). Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under age 50, 56% say wedding-related businesses should be required to serve same-sex and different-sex couples the same way while among those age 50 or older, 72% think they should not be required to do so. The big gay wedding cake quiz . Age differences hold across party lines, but the generation gap among Republicans and Republican-leaners is larger than that among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Overall, white evangelicals are broadly in favor of allowing businesses to refuse service for religious reasons - 62% say they should be able to. But among whites who are not evangelicals, 61% say such businesses should be required to provide services to all couples the same way. The shift from the Pew Center results comes across demographic lines. Men, women, whites, younger adults and senior citizens all are more apt than in the Pew poll to say wedding-related business should be required to serve same-sex couples as they do others. The CNN/ORC International poll was conducted by telephone, April 16-19, among a random national sample of 1,018 adult Americans. Results for the full poll have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Michigan auto repair shop says yes to gun owners, no to homosexuals .",

The Prime Minister took advice from martial arts pupils about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown. Sensing he may have gone too far with the threat to to wrestle his opponent to the ground, Mr Cameron later backtracked, insisting there will be 'no bodily contact' during the debate. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron took advice from martial arts pupils in Warrington about the best way to deal with the Ukip leader when they go up against each other in the two-hour showdown . The Tory leader paid a visit to the Kings Leadership Academy in Warrington ahead of the seven-way debate tonight . All of the party leaders have spent the day preparing for tonight's debate, with Mr Cameron facing the prospect of having to defend the Tory-led government from attack on several fronts. Mr Cameron visited King's Leadership Academy in Warrington, where he spoke to pupils about their favourite sports. Chatting in a playground, the Tory leader said: 'In this debate tonight, jujitsu, is that the right thing?' To laughter he added: 'Shall I get Nigel Farage and put him on the floor, is that OK?' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test . But later he played down the idea of physical violence, telling reporters: 'It was a joke. There'll be no bodily contact tonight.' Today Mr Cameron insisted he was not nervous and was 'relishing' the prospect of the two-hour debate in the ITV studios at Salford's MediaCityUK. Mr Cameron told reporters: 'It is a chance to get across that we have a long-term economic plan that is working.' For his part, Mr Farage said he was feeling 'pretty good' ahead of his TV test, telling Sky News: 'I hope the truth comes out on some issues. 'Particularly, I shall be arguing and asking the Prime Minister and others, will they please admit that, as members of the EU, we cannot have an immigration policy of any kind at all.' Mr Cameron and Mr Farage will share the platform tonight with \u00a0Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Green Party's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood. It is the only time Mr Cameron will go up against Mr Miliband, with one of them certain to be Prime Minister after May 7. The Prime Minister was accused by Labour of 'running scared' after dodging a head-to-head showdown with the Labour leader. After Mr Cameron objected to broadcasters' plans for three TV debates during the five-and-a-half week campaign, the ITV show marks the only occasion before the May 7 election when the Tory and Labour leaders will face each other. With all the polls pointing to an extremely tight contest, the leaders of the two biggest parties will be anxious to avoid any costly slips while looking for the opportunity to score points at expense of their rival. Mr Clegg said he would go for a walk to 'clear my head' before making his way to the TV studios, while Mr Miliband said the best preparation was 'getting out to meet people'. Labour leader Ed Miliband poses for a selfie with voters after holding a question and answer session in the Town Hall of Bury . Nick Clegg was in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, today while the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon attended the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood . Addressing supporters in Bury, Mr Miliband said the most important people on the night for him were not the other six leaders or moderator Julie Etchingham but 'the British public'. Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak. The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative). Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks. The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm. Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people. Conservative Chairman Grant Shapps arrives to meet party activists as he helps with their canvassing in  Somerset today . Green Party Leader Natalie Bennett meets supporters  in Piccadilly Gardens as she arrives in Manchester ahead of the TV debate . ITV newsreader Julie Etchingham\u00a0will keep order with just one ad break during the two-hour election showdown . Lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak, including the opening and closing statements and giving one-minute answers to the four studio audience questions . They will then be allowed to deliver an uninterrupted one-minute answer to each question, before 18 minutes of debate on each question. There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night. Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm. Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs said: 'The programme will provide a fair forum for a proper debate between the party leaders. 'Our viewers greatly valued the debates in 2010 and we know many are looking forward to this programme. 'It'll be an opportunity to hear the leaders directly challenge each other and discuss face-to-face some of the big election issues facing the country.",

    "source": "Jose Mourinho resisted the temptation until someone mentioned defending. Arsene Wenger had been talking about how it was easier to set up a team designed primarily to defend, just as Brendan Rodgers had ventured after Chelsea\u2019s victory at Liverpool, last year. \u2018It\u2019s not easy, not easy,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018If it was easy, you wouldn\u2019t lose 3-1 at home to Monaco. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It\u2019s not easy to defend.\u2019 Jose Mourinho hit back at Arsene Wenger during his pre-match press conference on Friday . Arsene Wenger (left) and Mourinho have over a decade of history in the Premier League . Arsene Wenger will be sick of the sight of Didier Drogba. He has scored 13 times for Chelsea against Arsenal, averaging a goal every 87 minutes. Monaco, ouch. Mourinho is not afraid to hit where it hurts. Arsenal have been brilliant since the turn of the year, but they were downright awful at home to Monaco. They conceded three and they crashed out of the Champions League. It was a blemish to support the theory that Arsenal are fine until the pressure is on. When Chelsea crashed out of Europe they were, as usual, snarling and disputing every decision. \u2018Maybe you will discover the Chelsea team are completely offensive and we are defensive for 90 minutes,\u2019 said Wenger, resorting to sarcasm as he assessed the clash at the Emirates on Sunday. \u2018Our job is to win football games and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in recent games. What\u2019s important for me is to do what it takes to win the game. It\u2019s easy to defend, if we have to defend then we will defend.\u2019 It is the issue at the heart of this ideological clash. On one side Wenger, committed to the romance of attractive football. On the other Mourinho, doing what it takes to win even if it proves ugly, stacking up the trophies. Beat Arsenal and Leicester, on Wednesday, and he will clinch the title. Arsenal lost 3-1 to Monaco in the Champions League - a result which Mourinho mentioned to the media . Prince Albert of Monaco celebrates with the away fans after the full-time whistle at the Emirates . Wenger looks dejected as he stands on the touchline during the Gunners' Champions League defeat . The challenge for Wenger is next season. Can he produce a team fit to fight for the title once again? \u2018We have played amazingly well for most of the season,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018In the last period we have been more strategic and less artistic because we had injuries and suspensions and lost the balance of our team. \u2018But we are having results. It is a great feeling to deal with the difficult moment in a strategic way. When you are lost at sea and you have no boat, you must survive. You build a raft.\u2019 Diego Costa\u2019s injuries and suspensions were Chelsea\u2019s shipwreck. Without his muscular spearhead, the balance was lost and it is three months since his team won by more than one goal. Still they win, taking six points from their last two games \u2014 against QPR and Manchester United \u2014 while recording a total of only three shots on target. They are, as Wenger says, efficient. \u2018We are top since day one,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018We are second in terms of goals scored. We are second best for goals conceded, the team with fewest defeats. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (second from left) scores against Manchester United last time out . Hazard scored the only goal of the game against United to take Chelsea a step closer to the league title . A TV camera gets a close-up of the goalscorer as Hazard celebrates with Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge . \u2018We have some of the best goals of the season, not individual action or shots like Charlie Adam\u2019s from midfield, but spectacular team goals. \u2018So, if we win the Premier League, we did everything right. It will be a great achievement. Looking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, it means a lot.\u2019 It will be the first title in five years at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal have not won it since 2004, the year of Wenger\u2019s Invincibles and the year Mourinho first swept into London claiming to be the Special One. Since then, two famous clubs have been soaked in the contrasting views of two men. Arsenal are Wenger, after more than 18 years of his leadership, and Chelsea have been Mourinho for more than a decade \u2014 even during his six-year absence. Mourinho (right) and Wenger have had plenty of touchline battles during their managerial careers . The pair rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital . Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue is restrained by Chelsea boss Mourinho during the 2007 League Cup final . They rarely miss the chance to damn with faint praise or hurl a snide remark across the capital. For many years, Wenger pursued Chelsea for \u2018financial doping\u2019 and, more recently, their tactical style, while Mourinho gorged on Arsenal\u2019s nine years with neither a trophy nor a managerial change. Mourinho has never lost to Wenger, a record which clearly eats away at the Frenchman, who exploded on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, in October, and shoved the Chelsea manager in the chest. There has been no apology. \u2018No, but I don\u2019t need that,\u2019 shrugged Mourinho, who remains incredulous that Wenger was not disciplined by the FA. Does he feel it would have been different had the roles been reversed? \u2018I don\u2019t feel, I know,\u2019 he said.",

    "source": "Indigenous Australian models have yet to make a significant impact on the runway but an exclusively Aboriginal modelling agency is in the swing of changing that cultural fashion landscape. The first name that comes to mind when thinking of Aboriginal models for even the most die-hard of fashionistas is Samantha Harris who was one of the most prominent faces during\u00a0Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia in Sydney this week. The only other indigenous face to join the 24-year-old stunner at the biggest week on the country's fashion calendar over the past two years is\u00a0Lauren Feenstra. On the rise: Adina-lee Vincent is one of the many emerging models signed with\u00a0Aboriginal Model Management Australia . Gaining ground: The agency started off with just five models and now has 40 including Noreen Carr (pictured) However, next year's annual global event will mark a significant shift if Aboriginal Model Management Australia founder\u00a0Kira-Lea Dargin gets her way. 'I expect at least five or 10 to be appearing in next year's fashion week,' she said. 'Realistically I would like to see up to 10 of our girls go through to next year's fashion week - we do have quite a few of them that have the potential,' she said. What started out as helping out a few modelling mates break into the industry two and half years ago quickly turned into a niche market that Aboriginal models have long been crying out for by the start of last year for the Russian-Aboriginal. Hot right now: Agency founder Kira-Lea Dargin hopes 10 of her girls will join Samantha Harris at next year's fashion week . In demand: Harris walked in a number of major shows at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia . Dargin began representing females who had the runway standards in terms of height and size. 'We focused on high fashion calibre models,' she said. 'We started out with five then it became 25 and now we have 40 models.' Now the agency is about to take on a whole new approach when casting begin for both female and male models aged anywhere up to 60 years old across five capital cities. The Facebook post for the casting call in Brisbane tomorrow has already attracted more than 350 shares and Dargin has received at least 400 emails with expressions of interest. 'I'm expecting the numbers to go ridiculous especially when we go onto Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth,' she said. Dargin says the high fashion market is slowly changing its perspective when it comes to indigenous models but she hoped it would move along more quickly (Cheyanne Fuller pictured) The 26-year-old is finding the mid-market range of big family chain stores such as Bonds, Target and Big W are particularly interested in hiring Aboriginal models for their catalogue campaigns. 'They are a lot more receptive opposed to the high fashion market because it has had a particular look for quite some time,' she said. 'It's a slow process but the perspective is changing - a lot of opportunities are opening but I personally would like to see it happen quicker but there is a lot of caution and a lot of stereotypes linked so you have to face that.' Dargin, whose father is Aboriginal and mother is Russian, faced discrimination when she started modelling in her teens. Big family chain stores such as Bonds, Target and Big W are particularly interested in hiring Aboriginal models for their catalogue campaigns (pictured Nyima Mcnamara) 'It was difficult to overcome both personally and professionally,' she said. 'I thought \"that's who I am - what's the problem with it?\".' She believes that the reason for casting agents hesitance to hire Aboriginal models was because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes. 'I think anytime you get involved with anything indigenous there is always that political aspect of what's happening in the community and what's happening across the nation and people assume that will come with it,' she said. 'But it's really important to separate individual events and be able to take it professionally and realise that not everyone slots into specific categories.' Dargin believes that high-end brands are hesitant to sign Aboriginal models because the concern is the fashion platform could be used for political purposes (pictured Zoe Byrne) Dargin says with Harris being the most famous Aboriginal face on the catwalk - she would like to see her act as a voice for young aspiring indigenous models. 'She's a very shy girl but I just think that she could come out of her shell a little bit more and be a spokesperson and promote Aboriginality for models in particular and just build a little bit more brand awareness,' she said. 'I think if she spoke up a bit more being in the position that she's in that it would help the next crop of young girls coming through.' Dargin encourages the models that she represents to embrace who their origins. 'I encourage our girls to be proud of who they are as a person and be proud of who they are in their cultural aspect but not to allow anybody else to target you based on other people's actions.' Kira-Lea Dargin hopes to have as many as 10 of her girls in next year's Australian Fashion Week .",

He is tough - he always goes for the victory and sometimes he is successful, sometimes he is less successful. But he definitely is a tough opponent for everyone. \u2018I don\u2019t want to think too far ahead - I am focusing on this fight and whatever is next, will happen. \u2018I am in really great shape. My training is great - I keep the same schedule of training and I am prepared and ready for this fight. \u2018I have been training with Stipe [Miocic] - he is a really great guy. We have been training really hard to prepare for both of our fights. He is just a great guy to train with and to be around. \u2018All of the people I have lost against, I always want to fight again. UFC decided it would be Gonzaga and yes I wanted this rematch very much.\u2019 Gonzaga, meanwhile, insists he does not view the fight as a rematch, given the eight-year wait. \u2018I didn\u2019t make any mistakes [in his last fight against Cro Cop] and he did make one, and I tried to capitalise on that,\u2019 he said. \u2018Eight years can change a lot. So much can change in that time so I do not consider this a rematch; I consider this a new fight. \u2018I\u2019ve got better in that time - my skill set has got better. \u2018I\u2019m going to try to avoid his high kick. But I will be ready wherever the fight goes. Gonzaga said he does not consider the fight with Filipovic a rematch because of the gap of eight years . Gonzaga believes that his skillset has got even better since the last time he took on Filipovic . \u2018That\u2019s the thing about the heavyweight division in the UFC, you know, one punch can change everything. \u2018I believe people are never going to forget our first fight.

Laura Wells has found international success as a size 14 model, including appearing in Cosmopolitan and Australian Women's Weekly magazines. Having lived and worked with other less curvy models in New York City, Wells has seen the shocking sacrifices they make to keep skinny. Scroll down for video . Laura Wells (left) has found international success as a size 14 model, including appearing in Cosmopolitan and Australian Women's Weekly magazines . 'It goes to the extremes - no food being eaten, prescription dietary pills, agents telling girls that they\u2019re only allowed to have one cracker and a couple glasses of water leading up to fashion week per day,' Wells told Australian Women's Weekly. The model believed this was not healthy and also took a toll on their mental health as well. 'These girls are going to the extremes to look like that and not being booked for any jobs and they're living with a plus-sized model who's working every single day, and comparing themselves to me who's eating really healthy,' she said. In the interview with the magazine, Wells also revealed she was very resistant to taking up a career as a fashion model. Wells was spotted by talent scouts in New York City in 2005 and said at first she was offended at being asked to be a plus-sized model because of her misconceptions about the term . The 177-centimetre beauty was studying science and law when she was spotted in New York City by talent scouts in 2005. She said she felt insulted the first time she was asked to be a plus-sized model because of her misconceptions about the term. 'I wanted to punch everyone in the face... [I thought] basically they were calling me fat,' Wells said. 'That was my perception of the word \"plus size\", that people were calling me \"fat\".' She has modelled for Myer, Macy's, David Jones, Bloomingdale's and Asos to name a few brands . Wells said while she was a plus-sized model who was defined as someone who was 'four to six sizes bigger than a standard model', she was not 'plus-sized in reality'. Since then Wells has gone to model for Macy's, Bloomingdale's, Myer, David Jones, Berlei and Asos.

Sarah, 23, was devastated to find out the man she's always thought was her father is not her biological parent as she appeared on today's Jeremy Kyle Show . Phil, who has raised Sarah, was equally upset to learn he is not her real father and was comforted by her and presenter Jeremy Kyle, left, on the ITV show . Presenter Jeremy Kyle, left, broke the news of the DNA test to Phil and Sarah . Sarah's mother had dropped the bombshell that Phil - who had raised Sarah - may not actually be related to her last year. In an experience akin to the plot of musical Mamma Mia, Sarah was told one of three men could be her father. Determined to find out the truth, the pair went on the Jeremy Kyle Show - famed for it's revealing DNA tests - to get an answer.

I'd be over the moon if he was my father. I don't know what I will do if he's not but he will still be like father to me.' Phil added: 'Whatever happens today she will still be my daughter. If she is, it will be the proudest day of my life.' Jeremy read a statement from Sarah's mother - who is no longer in contact with her daughter - in which she confirmed Phil was not Sarah's father.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground.

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere.

Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

Ms Hafford, who is still recovering, had been trying to get on the freeway in Houston when she honked at a passing SUV. She said the pair had an angry exchange and the driver  then began taunting her. A short time later, the motorist pulled up beside her, aimed a gun at the front passenger window of her red Dodge Avenge and pulled the trigger, reported\u00a0Click2Houston. Evans, 22, was arrested on suspicion of the shooting after detectives from Harris County Sheriff's Office say they discovered the gun  used to shoot through Hafford's window and a car matching the description of the shooter's. Shot fired: Officials say Hafford got into an angry confrontation with another driver and honked at him, prompting the man to fire on the passenger window of her Dodge Avenger (pictured) Officials confirmed that Evans, who is being held on $250,000 bond, is a documented gang member. Incredibly, Ms Hafford told Eyewitness News she wasn't angry with her attacker but felt sorry for him. On meeting him she said: 'It made me nervous. I just shed my few tears and I let it go. I knew without a shadow of a doubt, it was him. 'Seeing him made me hurt a little bit. I kinda feel sorry for him, but I'm not mad at him. I appreciate him coming forth. He just needs help and they got him.' The victim said she had prayed for police to catch her attacker or for him to give himself up and was delighted her prayers had been answered. Artistic: Both Hafford (right) and her husband of nearly two years, Kendrick Hafford (left), are musicians . Ms Hafford said the argument began when she was 'cut up' by the suspect as she turned into the feeder road to the North Freeway. He had driven alongside her shouting for her to roll down her window and as she entered the Freeway she said she heard a loud noise and felt pain in the back of her head. Despite the gunshot wound, she was able to pull over and dial 911. It took responding constables about 15 minutes to track down the woman's car and get her medical help, reported KHOU.\u00a0Paramedics who responded to the scene rushed her to Memorial Hermann Texas Trauma Institute. Ms Hafford, nee Kelley, works as a singer at a Houston-area church. Her husband of nearly two years, Kendrick Hafford, is also a musician, according to her Facebook page.

Scroll down for video . What a square! A dog shows off Taiwan's bizarre new pet-grooming trend after having his fur cut in a square . Hairdresser Tain Yeh, 42, who runs a parlour in Taipei said: 'I am aware of the trend although we don't have much request for it here because it's very difficult to keep the shape. 'It came about because people were always looking for more impressive haircuts, and somebody came up with the idea of shaping the dog like a hedge.'

Many are now opting for the cuts simply to get more likes and shares on social media sites. Ms Yeh added: 'The dogs don't mind, and the owners keep coming back for more. This sort of haircut needs a lot more maintenance then the regular type. 'It is also not suitable for all breeds.

Prosecutors said that Atkinson, who pleaded not guilty, repeatedly sexually assaulted a student, who is now 24 years old, according to SeaCoastOnline. John Goodwin, 75, shot himself outside of Rockingham County Superior Courthouse on Friday morning while jurors were deliberating claims that Goodwin had sexually assaulted an underage student .

The Wolves boss believes it is now just the top eight in the Sky Bet Championship who are fighting it out for the play-off places, with their 2-1 success at the City Ground all but ending the Reds' chances of making a late push. Wolves were fired on by a goal just 30 seconds into the second half from Benik Afobe, followed by a Bakary Sako penalty in the 72nd minute. Dexter Blackstock pulled one back for Forest four minutes into injury time, but it was too little, too late. Bakary Sako celebrates after scoring Wolves' second goal in a 2-1 win at Nottingham Forest on Good Friday . Manager Kenny Jackett has told his side that they need to keep their focus to maintain a promotion push . And Jackett does not want Wolves to let their promotion push slip away now, saying: We just need to keep winning our games and not worry about other sides. It looks like the top eight will be involved now, although I don't know if Forest will have an opinion on that. 'We have to follow this win up with another against Leeds now, there will be a big crowd at Molineux and we have to focus on that now. 'The mood is very determined, there is good focus among the players and we are keen to keep improving.' Jackett was particularly delighted for Afobe, who he had previously taken on loan at Millwall, saying: 'He is repaying our faith but we worked together at Millwall and I am delighted to have him permanently now. He was ready for a permanent home. Dougie Freedman believes the difference between the two sides was a simple composure in front of goal . 'I'm delighted to have won. I felt that Forest put us under a lot of pressure in the first 20 minutes, a lot of energy, the crowd were right behind them. We defended well in that period, very well. Then we came through it and started to look a threat ourselves. 'Then just after half time, Afobe's scored a fantastic goal that, in a tight game, has put our noses in front. After that we were very professional, we got the second goal, we needed it and it was a good overall performance.' Forest boss Dougie Freedman says the difference between the two sides was simple composure in front of goal. Wolves striker Afobe (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after putting them ahead in the second half . 'The difference was that they took their chances when they came along. There was not a lot in it, they just took their chances when they came their way,' he said. 'When they scored just after half time, our team talk went out the window. But you have to take your chances against the top sides and we had plenty of them. 'The ability to take chances is what cost us in the end. They took theirs and we did not make the most of ours. Afobe made the difference, because he took his goal superbly. 'We had opportunities to win the game, we had sustained pressure on their goal. But we did not have the cutting edge we needed.'",

Jamie Pettingill, who threatened to slice off a schoolboy's face, was ordered to complete 350 hours of community service after being found guilty of stealing six mobile phones. Pettingill robbed two women, a man and two schoolboys of their phones, and sold them to fund a gambling addiction he was hiding from his family, County Court Judge Sandra Davis said. Scroll down for video . Jamie Pettingill, who threatened to slice off a schoolboy's face, was ordered to complete 350 hours of community service after being found guilty of stealing six mobile phones . In the most serious incident he flashed a knife at a schoolboy, telling him 'Don't f**k with me, I'll cut your f**king face off', as he stole the boy's mobile phone. Judge Davis decided against putting Pettingill behind bars, due to fears his surname would attract unwanted attention and interfere with his rehabilitation. The judge also accepted Pettingill's crime spree was an 'unsophisticated, spur of the moment' act. The 26-year-old was ordered to pay more than $5000 in compensation for the mobile phones he had stolen, and was banned him from entering gaming venues. Pettingill robbed two women, a man and two schoolboys of their phones, and sold them to fund a gambling addiction he was hiding from his family, County Court Judge Sandra Davis said .

A police officer saved the life of a unconscious heroin user, only for the man to flee without a thank you when he was taken to hospital. Patrick O\u2019Melia, 39, a deputy with the Volusia County Sheriff\u2019s Office, was flagged down while he was on patrol near DeLand in Florida and asked to help 34-year-old Justin Braddock.

Braddock, who had injected a large amount of the drug that day, was taken to hospital but fled, according to the Daytona Beach News Journal.

    "source": "This will prove yet another bitter pill for Saracens to swallow. The hurt of losing back-to-back European and domestic finals last year took Mark McCall\u2019s men all of last summer and a good chunk of this season to overcome. This time they must lick their wounds and refocus their efforts on the Aviva Premiership after coming up short against Clermont. Clermont warm up in front of their supporters at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne . Clermont centre Wesley Fofana attempts an offload following a crunching hit from Marcelo Bosch . Saracens flanker Maro Itojie secures a loose ball on the deck during a tight first half of action . There should be no shame in this defeat. Whereas Northampton capitulated embarrassingly against the same opponents a fortnight ago, Saracens stood tall on Saturday. Saracens\u2019 long-suffering chairman Nigel Wray, who has pumped tens of millions of pounds into this club over the past two decades, took the opportunity on Saturday morning to repeat his conviction that English clubs will never be able to compete with French teams if the domestic salary cap is not raised. But it can only be a matter of time before Saracens deliver. With five of their starting pack under the age of 24 \u2014 all English qualified \u2014 they have forwards who will surely develop into a world-class outfit. Twenty-year-old Maro Itoje was impressive making his first start in Europe, while the Vunipola brothers were magnificent. Ultimately the better side won, and Clermont will head into their second European final confident they can land their first European title. Saracens pressurised Clermont with the same fierce defence that knocked them so spectacularly off their stride in last year\u2019s semi-final at Twickenham. Sarries No 8 Billy Vunipola makes a strong run as\u00a0Radosavljevic tries to halt his progress . The difference this time was that Clermont knew what was coming and were able to keep their wits about them, buoyed by a partisan crowd. \u2018I\u2019ve never experienced an atmosphere like that,\u2019 said McCall. \u2019The effort and many aspects of our performance were phenomenal. We made Clermont play a a game they didn\u2019t want to play. The game was on a knife edge with 10 minutes to go but games like that are decided by small margins.\u2019 As evidence of their dominance, Clermont will point to Wesley Fofana\u2019s superbly taken second-half try and a 19th-minute incident which saw Naipolini Nalaga denied what should have been a penalty try. Chris Ashton knocked him into touch without attempting to wrap his arms around him. Saracens full back Alex Goode tries to sidestep Clermont scrum half\u00a0Ludovic Radosavljevic . But, had Jacques Burger been able to cling on to a knock-on from Nalaga with less than 10 minutes on the clock after Richard Wigglesworth\u2019s superb chase and tackle of Alex Goode\u2019s clearance, Saracens could so easily have won this game. It is hard to comprehend how the club will pick themselves up from yet another shattering defeat to deliver domestic silverware. But, after winning at Racing Metro in the quarter final while watching Premiership rivals Northampton capitulate to Clermont two weeks ago, McCall\u2019s men still have every chance of delivering a trophy this season. \u2018It won\u2019t deter us from our goal,\u2019 insisted Wigglesworth, who is playing the best rugby of his career. Richard Wigglesworth feeds the ball into a Saracens scrum as referee George Clancy watches on . \u2018It\u2019s easy to focus on the negatives when we have just lost a game like that. But we\u2019re unbelievably proud of that performance and we\u2019ve got a week to rest out battered bodies and go again.\u2019 Saracens face Northampton at Stadium MK next Saturday, before having the following weekend off when they will watch on enviously as Clermont contest the Champions Cup final at Twickenham against either Leinster or Toulon, who will go head to head on Sunday. But on reflection, Saracens will be buoyed by this performance. Itoje is a rare prospect capable of explosive bursts of power and hugely athletic around the field while Billy and Mako Vunipola are two of the most destructive carriers in Europe. They have both returned to their best following a slow start to the season, while Saracens scrum is also in fine shape. Saracens fly half Charlie Hodgson clears his lines under pressure from the Clermont defence . Charlie Hodgson missed two critical long-range penalties on Saturday but the veteran fly half has been magnificent this season and the second-half appearance of Owen Farrell from the bench saw the England No 10 make his first appearance since rupturing knee ligaments in January. With Schalk Britz and Brad Barritt both fit again, only the absence of Captain Alistair Hargreaves with concussion-related symptoms weakens McCall\u2019s squad. They will hurt from this no doubt. But in the cold light of day, Saracens will realise many of their boys became men on Saturday. The future remains bright for them on the field.",

    "source": "A new Kansas law tells poor families that they can't use cash assistance from the state to attend concerts, go swimming, visit theme parks or buy lingerie. The list of don'ts runs to several dozen items. More than 20 other states have such lists. But, the one included by the Republican-dominated Kansas Legislature in a bill that GOP Gov. Sam Brownback planned to sign Thursday appears to be the most exhaustive, according to state Department for Children and Families officials. The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four. To qualify that family must have an annual household income below $31,525 - before taxes - and assets valued at less than $2,000. Cutting back: In this April 13 photo, Kansas Republican Gov. Sam Brownback makes a point during an interview in his office in the Statehouse in Topeka, Kansas . The new restrictions, regarding Kansas applicants, have inspired national criticism and mockery from The Daily Show. Host Jon Stewart suggested that in accepting federal funds, Kansas should be forced to give up items like roads 'paved with luxurious asphalt.' 'The list has attracted attention because it feels mean-spirited,' said Shannon Cotsoradis, president and CEO of the advocacy group Kansas Action for Children. 'It really seems to make a statement about how we feel about the poor.' It is part of a broader welfare law taking effect in July that Brownback and his allies say is aimed at moving poor families from social services into jobs. In Kansas, here\u2019s a list of what would be forbidden to those using cash assisted funds: . 'We want to get people off of public assistance and into private-sector employment, and we've had a lot of success with that,' Brownback during an interview this week with The Associated Press. A 2012 federal law requires states to prevent benefit-card use at liquor stores, gambling establishments or adult-entertainment businesses. At least 23 states have their own restrictions on how cards can be used, mostly for alcohol, tobacco, gambling and adult-oriented businesses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A few states - not Kansas - prohibit buying guns, according to the NCSL, and a few ban tattoos or body piercings. Massachusetts prohibits spending on jewelry, bail bonds, or 'vacation services.' A 2014 Louisiana law bars card use on cruise ships, which is also on the Kansas list. Kansas Department for Children and Families officials said that it's difficult to track how often cash assistance is used for items on the state's new list because recipients can use their benefits cards to obtain cash. The law will limit ATM withdrawals of cash assistance to $25 a day. The department said it reclaimed $199,000 in cash assistance from 81 fraud cases from July through February, but said most involved questions about eligibility. The state provided $14 million in cash assistance during the same period. A 2014 federal report said a check of eight states' data showed transactions with benefit cards at liquor stores, casinos or strip clubs accounted for less than 1 percent of the total. Critics question whether such restrictions can be enforced. Elizabeth Schott, senior fellow with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said enacting them simply creates an 'aura of abuse.' 'Undermining support for the programs is what the restrictions do,' she said. Phyllis Gilmore, Kansas secretary for children and families, said her state's list is a 'composite' of others and has educational value, sending the message that cash assistance should be used for necessities. 'Every dollar that is used fraudulently is a dollar that is not going to an American who is struggling,' said state Sen. Michael O'Donnell, a Wichita Republican who supported the bill. Helping hand: The taxpayer-funded Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, currently provides cash payments of up to $497 per month for a family of four . Much of the new Kansas law codifies administrative policies enacted after Brownback took office in January 2011, so they'll be harder to undo later. They include a requirement that cash assistance recipients work at least 20 hours a week, be looking for work or enroll in job training. The new law also includes a much-criticized provision shortening the lifetime cap on cash assistance to 36 months from 48 months, although the state Department for Children and Families said recipients rarely bump up against the lower limit. The number of cash assistance recipients in Kansas has dropped 63per cent since Brownback took office, to about 14,700 in February. Brownback said the decline confirms the success of his policies, but critics note that U.S. Census Bureau figures show the state's child poverty rate remaining at about 19per cent through 2013. Brownback said his state's list of prohibited cash-assistance uses has become a way for the left to argue against welfare-to-work policies. 'I think you're seeing the left trying to pillory this,' Brownback said. 'They're just trying to poke fun at it, when it's not what the debate is really about.'",

    "source": "Groups of football fans are responsible for thuggish behaviour on trains on a weekly basis, a senior police officer has said. The warning by British Transport Police (BTP) Chief Constable Paul Crowther came ahead of a summit organised to determine the scale of the problem, which has come under scrutiny in recent months following a number of high-profile incidents. The latest figures for this football season show that BTP has recorded 630 football-related incidents so far, including a number with a racial element. Five Chelsea fans were caught on film directing racist abuse towards a black passenger in France . Fans appeared to be chanting on the Paris Metro train: 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' Mr Crowther said: 'Sadly this type of casual thuggery is occurring just about on a weekly basis on our trains, with a sizeable minority who are behaving in a threatening, loud and sometimes racist way to the great terror of people who are using the system to get about and do their day-to-day business.' He said the impact on ordinary passengers is 'unacceptable', adding: 'We are in danger of saying those types of experiences are OK. 'Is that the sort of society we really want? I don't think it is. We haven't solved this type of behaviour and we need to work together to change it. 'We are saying 'Why do people think this is acceptable on trains?' You don't see this sort of behaviour on an aeroplane, for example.' Police believe the scale of football-related crime on the transport network may be higher than the figures show. Mr Crowther said: 'We think it is under-reported and we think that might be because people are intimidated or frightened.' Supporters have come under scrutiny (none of the fans pictured are necessarily referred to in the story) He said the problem was a 'very complex issue' and required a cultural change. 'What I am not looking for is more of the same,' he said. 'I don't think it is an issue we can arrest our way out of.' Representatives from football, police and other organisations, as well as those affected by football thuggery, are attending the summit, which is the first of its kind. In February a storm erupted after Chelsea supporters were filmed allegedly singing racist chants as a black man was prevented from boarding a train in Paris.",

    "source": "Raheem Sterling and Theo Walcott will likely go head-to-head at the Emirates on Saturday. They are at starkly different places in their careers with 26-year-old Walcott perhaps acting as a cautionary tale for Sterling, 20, that early promise can sometimes give way to unfulfilled potential. Both are in the process of negotiating contracts with their respective clubs. Brendan Rodgers has spoken in the past of his admiration for Walcott while Wenger has made no secret he is a fan of Sterling.\u00a0It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the clubs could do a direct swap. Although Wenger would have to deviate from his usually cautious financial approach to win the race to sign Sterling while Rodgers would be hard pushed to sell Walcott as a worthy replacement for Sterling. Here Sportsmail looks at the merits of the two English wingers. Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling, England's leading wingers, are both in contract negotians with their clubs . Sterling has been one of Liverpool's best players this season, but his contract dispute has caused problems . THIS SEASON SO FAR . Sterling: He has been one of Liverpool\u2019s best players throughout the season, making 28 Premier League appearances and scoring six top-flight goals while boasting an impressive 81% pass completion rate. He has as struggled to make an impact since being used as a wing-back. Walcott: There\u2019s not a lot to go on for Walcott, who has played just 13 games in all competitions, struggling for game time after returning from a long-term layoff for a knee injury. Arsenal do seem to perform slightly better when Walcott features, winning 62.50% of their Premier League games when he is in the team, compared to 59.1% without him. TEAM PLAYER? Sterling: While Sterling\u2019s contract negotiations might be viewed as a distraction to the team he has been an unselfish and determined player during his career so far, providing seven assists in the Premier League this season. He has linked up well with Daniel Sturridge before the striker was injured and happily played second fiddle to Luis Suarez last season when Brendan Rodgers built his team around the Uruguayan. Walcott: Is always encouraging to younger players and a good influence to have in the dressing room but he has failed to provide one assist this season and rarely contributes to defensive duties. Walcott looked out of sorts for England this week, and has not yet provided an assist this season . Sterling turns away from Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs when the two clubs met earlier this season . WOW FACTOR . Sterling:\u00a0Sterling is undoubtedly exciting, can provoke disbelief with his mazy runs and deceptive strength for someone so slight. But his biggest strength is his pace. His top speed this season of 21.77 mph puts him sixth in the Premier League rankings. The problem could lie in the fact he may not be as good as he thinks he is. Walcott: The off-the-mark pace and an eye for the unconventional yet effective pass which made Walcott a sensation as a 16-year-old playing for Southampton have waned somewhat. Although he is still quick, his fastest sprint this season registering at 21.11 mph, a series of injuries have impacted his speed. His inventiveness off-the-ball has been dulled by a lack of confidence. If he can have a period of uninterrupted play he might be able to recapture some of his \u2018wow factor\u2019 but he is never going to be a world-class player or a game changer. First team opportunities have been limited for Walcott this season, with the winger frustrated by injury . Sterling has scored six times and created 62 chances in the Premier League this season . FANS' FAVOURITE? Sterling: Sterling has damaged his public image, possibly irreparably, in the red half of Merseyside with protracted contract wrangling over recent weeks. He said in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Natalie Perks that he wanted to dispel the idea he was a greedy 20-year-old. But he could have done that simply by signing a \u00a3100,000 a week contract at a club where he plays regularly and the manager is proven at developing young talent, if that really was the case. Walcott:\u00a0He is a likeable personality, rarely in the headlines for the wrong reasons, but fans will ultimately judge him on his play and Walcott seems to divide opinion. He has flashes of brilliance but his form is erratic and fans want someone they can count on. THE FUTURE . Sterling:\u00a0It is easy to forget Sterling, who made his full Liverpool debut at 17 years, 107 days, is still only 20. On the face of it his future is blindingly bright and his potential boundless. Sterling has hit a top speed of 21.77 mph this season, ranking him sixth in the Premier League.  Walcott's fastest speed this season is 21.11 mph. Clubs all over Europe are said to be monitoring him and he has admitted it is his dream to play for a big club \u2018somewhere warm\u2019 but we have seen all too many times young talent going unrealised. The decisions Sterling and his advisors make in the coming months could be crucial. Walcott:\u00a0For Walcott, who was selected for his first World Cup at 16, the last six years have been marred by a failure to deliver on his promise. Those clubs who might be interested in signing him should take encouragement from the fact we might not have seen the best of Walcott yet. Sterling might have permanently damaged his relationship with the Liverpool fans with his interview . The 20-year-old could still stay at Anfield beyond this summer if manager Brendan Rodgers gets his way .",

It was a terrfici ball in, Balotelli has a good touch and he's in on goal. You need those to go for you.'

    "source": "Two French backpackers who filmed themselves torching a native Australian quokka have been released from prison. Thibaud Jean Leon Vallet, 24, and his cousin Jean Mickael Batrikian, 18, pleaded guilty to animal cruelty after footage emerged of the pair lighting the quokka on fire with an aerosol can and a lighter on Rottnest Island on April 3. The pair appeared before Fremantle Magistrate's Court last Friday and were ordered to pay $4000 and were told that they would be held behind bars for seven days if they fail to pay the fines. Scroll down for video . The two French tourists charged with setting fire to a quokka have been released from jail after spending a week behind bars . The French men opted to serve the seven days in Hakea prison rather than pay the fine, as they did not have sufficient funds. A Department of Corrective Services spokeswoman said that the week long sentence was considered the equivalent of the fine, and that it had been served in full, reported WA Today. The men were released at 11.30 am on Thursday morning after entering the jail, in Canning Vale, Western Australia on Friday. According to Corrective Services, the two French men cost taxpayers $1810 each day they were in jail, despite the fact that the pair had saved over $12,000 between them in their working holiday employment as cleaners, reported The Esperance Express. The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame . Animal rights activists have claimed that the pair's punishment was too lenient for their crime . Using a deodorant can and lighter, the men torch the defenseless creature which quickly scampers away . Animal rights activists have claimed that the pair's punishment was too lenient for their crime. 'It was pretty disgusting,' said Peter Murphy from Quokka Rescue. 'I don't think the sentence is enough. I think they got off quite lightly.' The video of the crime was played in court on Friday, and Magistrate Elizabeth Langdon labelled the act 'outrageous', reported The West Australian. In the disturbing footage of their crime, both men are heard laughing uncontrollably after igniting the quokka before one said 'Don't do that, why?' The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame. The magistrate was told that Vallet and Batrikian were remorseful for their actions, and that they admitted the incident was stupid and juvenile. The men can be heard uncontrollably laughing after igniting the native Australian creature . The quokka is\u00a0a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick brown fur . Magistrate Langdon commented on their cruelty, calling the offence 'abhorrent.' 'One can only imagine the impact caused to the quokka,' she said. 'Obviously it would have been fearful as a result of what occurred.' The men told Fairfax Media outside court on Saturday, 'you think we're monsters? We didn't hurt the quokka. We have pets at home.' Both men were on a working holiday and were spending three months in Rottnest Island working as cleaners. As a result of the incident, both men lost their job. They also had their passports confiscated and are expected to be leaving Australia soon. The quokka, classed by the government as 'vulnerable', is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick, rough, grey-brown fur. It is found only in the south-west of Western Australia state and on the offshore islands of Rottnest and Bald.",

Intrepid Travel, who run 800 trips across the world and have 100,000 customers each year, have decided not to take any more bookings to Nepal until May 11. And those who are planning on travelling out before this date with existing bookings have been offered a full refund or alternative trip. Scroll down for video . As the search goes on for those missing in the earthquake, the British Foreign Office has advised tourists in Nepal to follow the advice from local authorities . The company confirmed to MailOnline Travel that their 200 clients who are currently in the country have all been accounted for and are safe. 'While we are continuing to concentrate on the safety of our clients out in Nepal, we have decided to cancel all our trips to the country until May 11 while the rescue operation is underway,' said a spokesperson. 'Safety is our main priority, and even after this date, we may have to recommend our customers to book to visit somewhere else. 'No-one knows how long the rescue operation will go on for, but in the short term we wouldn't advise anyone to visit after such a disaster.' Intrepid Group has been running tours to Nepal for 36 years and has a team of local operators on the ground constantly monitoring the situation. Nepal\u2019s capital Kathmandu \u2013 with a population of over one million \u2013 was one of the worst-hit areas in Nepal, with the quake\u2019s epicentre just 50 miles north of the city. As the tremors intensified, people were seen in scenes of mayhem running from their homes and places of work in panic. Dozens of people were gathered in the car park of Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some patients wearing hospital pyjamas, while doctors and nurses were treating people. Around 1,000 tourists have amassed at\u00a0Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu in the hope of getting out of Nepal following the earthquake . Jordan Torrilla, Nepal expert with luxury holiday company Kuoni has warned tourists what they should expect if they honour their trips to the Asian country. 'As with any aftermath of a natural disaster, there will be a frenzy, and it certainly won't be calm and tranquil',' he told MailOnline Travel. 'There will be an atmosphere of worry, people will be doing emergency shopping, and obviously it wouldn't be a great time to be going out there. 'There are always times when people have to travel out to these destinations after a disaster, tourists just have to be aware of the people and what they will be going through. 'You are certainly not going to be number one, not going to be the priority. It's important you have a deep level of patience as it will be very difficult for the local to prioritise you when they may be dealing with severe family issues and loss of life.' And a spokesperson for Trailfinders confirmed that their customers scheduled to travel to Nepal in the next couple of days have been contacted and advised against making the trip. All 12 bookings they have out in Nepal have been accounted for and plans are being made to return them home. People survey the rubble of damaged buildings a day after a massive earthquake in Nepal . Meanwhile the Foreign Office advice is that British tourists should check with their travel provider before heading to Nepal. The importance of following local authorities' advice as well as keeping an eye on news and updates has also been highlighted as critical for anyone who may have been caught up in the disaster. And the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) told MailOnline Travel that tourists should be aware that Nepal is always considered a country of 'high-risk' of earthquake, and that their main focus is on helping Britons caught up in the disaster. 'We advise people to stay in a place of safety and follow any advice provided by local authorities,' a spokesperson said. 'The situation is always changing, so it's important to keep an eye on local news providers. 'Our general advice to anyone who is set to travel, or currently travelling, out there would be to check with your travel provider, and to make sure you keep abreast of the situation. 'We have a dedicated phone number that people can call if they have any questions at all about the situation, and this can be about outward travel too.' The earthquake's epicentre was Kathmandu, but aftershocks and tremors have been felt in another three countries . The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes. The 7.8 magnitude tremor was the worst to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. Television footage showed a huge swathe of houses had collapsed in while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact. Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu has re-opened following the disaster, but with over a thousand people queuing overnight, the journey out of Nepal will be problematic for tourists. NDTV reports that a queue 'perhaps a kilometre long' has grown outside Nepal's only international airport, with many families having to go without food and water in the hope of leaving the country. A statement on the FCO website reads: 'The British Embassy would seek to help British nationals to leave as soon as possible following a major natural disaster. Around 2,000 people are thought to have died in Nepal alone, with hundred still missing . 'However, Kathmandu\u2019s Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be unusable following a large-scale earthquake, as will Nepal\u2019s road network. It could take some days for it to become operational.' A spokesperson for the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) told MailOnline Travel: 'Travellers in Nepal are advised to monitor local news and media reports and to follow any advice and instructions issued by the authorities and by the Foreign Office. 'ABTA works closely with its Members and with the Foreign Office to ensure the safety of any customers and staff affected. 'British travellers in Nepal or those due to travel should contact their holiday company who will help them with any concerns.' Nepalese rescue members and onlookers gather at the collapsed Darahara Tower in Kathmandu; tourists are now making their way to\u00a0Tribhuvan International Airport in the hope of avoiding another disaster . Around 40,000 British Nationals are reported to have visited Nepal in 2013. Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond has said his thoughts are with everyone who has been affected by the natural disaster, and that the British government are in 'close contact' with their Nepalese counterparts. 'The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals,' he added. This morning, a 6.7 magnitude aftershock struck India and Nepal, shaking buildings in New Delhi and triggering an avalanche in the Himalayas. The earthquake also triggered a massive avalanche on Mount Everest killing 18 people and injuring at least 30 climbers. There are also a number of climbers still missing, including a number of Britons. If you are a British national currently in Nepal and wish to inform the FCO of your whereabouts you should contact them on  +44 207 008 0000. This number can also be called for anybody who has concerns about visiting the region affected by the earthquake.",

A grieving daughter has come up with an unusual way to keep the memory of loved ones alive - by bottling their scent. Seven years ago, Katia Apalategui's mother coped with losing her husband by holding on to his pillowcase which his smell clung to. This inspired the 52-year-old French insurance saleswoman to think of a more permanent way to capture a person's individual scent in a bid to help others in mourning. The strong link between smell and memory is the reason her product will provide 'olfactory comfort' to customers, she says. 'We are going through funeral homes to offer families a small box containing a vial of the departed's odour that we would have extracted from a piece of material provided by them,' she said. But the 'made-to-measure' perfumes will be rather costly and be priced at around 560 euros (\u00a3400). To help develop her idea, she teamed up with the Havre university in France, where researchers have developed a technique to reproduce the human smell. The university's Geraldine Savary explained the process involved taking a person's clothes and extracting the odour - a few hundred characteristic molecules - which is then made into a bottle of perfume in four days. She said: 'There was a perfect synergy between what she wanted to do and what our researchers are doing so we decided to get involved. 'There is a very strong link between memory and smell which is similar to that between the memories we have from looking at old photos, videos and other things. 'We take the person's clothing and extract the odour, which represents about a hundred molecules, and we reconstruct it in the form of a perfume in four days.' She came up with a more permanent way to capture a person's individual scent in a bid to help others in mourning. File photo . Popular Science reports the classic process of perfume distillation is the most likely method, which involves passing steam through an object at high temperatures and capturing the result. And Ms Apalategui, although first inspired by death, is hoping her product could be also be ideal Valentine's Day gifts or even for children away from their parents. Her son, who is in business school, is planning to launch by September this year.",

Susannah Ross, 20, told friends she was going trekking last week but has not been heard from since Friday and may be unable to contact her loved ones at home in Britain. While many of those initially reported missing have since been found safe and well, there are still several dozen British travellers who have not been heard from since the disaster on Saturday morning. Missing: Susannah Ross, pictured, is among the dozens of Britons currently in Nepal who have not been heard of since Saturday's earthquake . Couple: Chloe Pincho and Brennan White, pictured, were climbing Mount Everest when the earthquake hit two days ago . A number of Britons were climbing Mount Everest at the time of the quake, while others were staying in the capital Kathmandu or trekking through rural areas. Miss Ross's family said today that they had been unable to contact the backpacker since the disaster struck and were increasingly concerned about her. She had recently set off on a three-week trek and warned relatives at home in Bath they might not hear from her during that time, but they now hope she will call to let them know she is safe. Her mother Judy said: 'We are just waiting around really. We don't know what is going on. Before the trek she said, \"Don't expect to hear from me necessarily until I get back.\" We are doing what we can.' The 20-year-old worked as a waitress to save money for her trip to Asia, where she worked at a farm in Nepal before going trekking. She was due to continue to India for a yoga course in June. Among the other Britons who have not been in contact with home since the 7.8 magnitude earthquake are a middle-aged married couple. Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. Appeal: Tom Southgate, left, and Samuel Beckett, right, have not been heard of since the disaster . Search: Matt Carapiet, left, and Jack Kilpatrick, right, are currently the subject of online appeals from their desperate families . Fears are growing over Julius Olatokunbo, 53, from Forest Hill in south-east London, after a climber wrote online that he had been 'taken with an avalanche' and separated from his group. Relatives of Samuel Beckett, 23, who was in Kathmandu at the time of the quake, say they are concerned because they have not heard from him in a week. Speaking from his home in Leicester, his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. He is still listed as missing. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' A couple from Carshalton in Surrey, Chloe Pincho and Brennan White, were trekking up Mount Everest at the time of the disaster and their whereabouts is now unknown. The parents of Matt Carapiet, 23, from Kent made an online appeal for him to contact them after he went missing in the wake of the crisis. Abroad: Martin Gattuso, left, lives in Nepal where he is a Buddhist monk; Jake Whyles, right, was visiting the mountainous country . 41-year-old Scottish woman Seobhan McGuigan and Jack Young, 21, from Lincolnshire are two more Britons to be on the list of the missing. 59-year-old Janet Brownlie and Jack Kilpatrick, 24, from Teddington in Middlesex, are also out of contact. Judith Ridgewell, who is in her 40s and from Cornwall, has gone missing on her travels, and Jake Whyles, 24, from Lincolnshire is also out of contact. Gary Williams, 52, from Plymouth was last heard from on Friday night, when he sent an email to his relatives while trekking in Nepal. Norah Arscott, 77, from Somerset; Philip Green, 30, from London; and Shaun Bailey, 27, from Stoke-on-Trent are all reported as missing. 24-year-old Naomi Everett, from Cheshire, is also on the Red Cross list of the missing, along with Lloyd Davies, 22, from Beckenham. Rescue: The scene at Everest base camp after the earthquake killed a number of climbers on the world's tallest mountain . Carnage: A building in Bhaktapur, near Kathmandu, which was almost completely destroyed by the natural disaster . Another missing teenager is Annette Burd, 18, from Leicestershire, while relatives of Tom Southgate, 23, are anxiously waiting to hear from him in Nottingham and Heather Stretton, 47, from Lincolnshire is also missing. Richard Jones, 33, from Worcestershire went missing while trekking in Annapurna; Victoria Barkas, 34, and Ian Norquay, from Sussex have also been in the area. Also missing are two Britons who have moved to South Asia - Simon Charlesworth, 49, and Buddhist monk Martin Gattuso, 38, originally from Norfolk. Around 10 British-born expats living in Australia are currently being sought. A number of other British travellers were initially reported missing but were able to contact their families within a day or two. These included Sebastian Lovera, 22, who was hiking to Mount Everest at the time of the earthquake but has now returned to Kathmandu to help victims of the disaster. Teenager Michael Walker, a gap-year student from Exeter who had been trekking in the region, was found safe and well today after his parents and former teachers issued an appeal. Abdulla Dahab, 21, from London was also located for the first time today, allaying the fears of his family who had not heard from him as he set off on a mountain climb at the time the earthquake hit.",

The mini-Martha Stewart, who is known simply as Charli, has turned her popular channel, CharlisCraftyKitchen into YouTube's largest food channel in less than three years - beating household names such as celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to claim the prestigious \u2013 and lucrative \u2013 title. According to data compiled by online video advertising company Outrigger Media, Charli's channel earned the young entrepreneur an estimated $127,777 (AUD $163,893) in March alone \u2013 and that is after YouTube's share of the profits. Scroll down for video . Mini-Martha: Charli, an eight-year-old from Australia (pictured), makes an estimated $127,000 (AUD $162,472) per month from the ad revenue generated from her popular YouTube channel\u00a0CharlisCraftyKitchen . In comparison, Mr Oliver only earned an estimated $32,261\u00a0(AUD $41,347) in ad revenue from his channel's 6.9 million views last month. Meanwhile, Charli and her five-year-old sister Ashlee, who serves as the channel's 'chief taste tester', are raking in an average of 29 million views per month for their crafty how-to videos. CharlisCraftyKitchen, which features child friendly tutorials for making everything from Minnie Mouse pops out of Oreos to princess teacup cookies, also has more than 320,000 subscribers who eagerly await their weekly posts. The tutorials even have their own short opening credits featuring Charli and Ashlee's cartoon likenesses, with one of the girl's singing: 'Welcome to Charli's Crafty Kitchen where you can eat what you make'. Big numbers: Charli and her five-year-old sister Ashlee's how to video on making Frozen-inspired ice pops has earned 57 million views since it was posted last July . Being silly: The sisters made a mess while eating their 'shark' Jello cups . Many of clips are inspired by the holidays, with a demonstration on how to make a Kit Kat Christmas cake receiving more than two million views since it was posted in December. One particular video featuring a simple recipe for 'rainbow' donuts has been watched more than 6.5 million times after it was shared in 2014. But that's nothing. A video which sees the dynamic duo creating Jello 'tip' ice pops inspired-by the hit Disney film Frozen has amassed an incredible 57 million views since it was posted last June. Charli earned another million views after she advertised the clip on her Facebook page yesterday, writing: '56 million YouTube views must mean these \u202a#\u200eFrozen inspired popsicles are REALLY tasty! [sic]' Disney kids: Charli and Ashlee used icing and M&M's to make Cinderella brownie jar treats . 'My [two]-year-old loves watching this video and we make them all the time. They are a huge hit in our household. Thank you,' one mom commented, while another joked: 'My five-year-old might account for a few hundred of [the views].' Charli started CharlisCraftyKitchen in 2012 when she was only six-years-old according to her channel's description, which notes that she 'has always been passionate about her craft and being in front of a camera'. But Chali isn't the only kid making big money off of beloved YouTube videos. Mark and Rhea, the parents behind the popular YouTube channel\u00a0Hulyan Maya, are expected to earn\u00a0$1.5 million dollars from ad revenue in 2015 alone from their videos of their three children playing with toys.

The man, who has been named locally as 62-year-old Richard Clements, is believed to have been mowing grass outside his property in Wattisham, Suffolk, when the machine toppled down a bank into the water and trapped him. His family managed to drag him from the pond and made frantic efforts to save him but he was pronounced dead at the scene. A man, in his 60s, has died after the ride-on lawnmower he was using to cut the grass at a farmhouse property in Wattisham, Suffolk, overturned into a pond. Pictured: An air ambulance at the scene yesterday . Friends today told of their shock at the incident, which occurred in the quiet village just before 5.15pm yesterday. Peter Mead, the secretary of Stowmarket Meadlands Recreation Club which Mr Clements had been chairman of for around 30 years, said they grew up together. The 70-year-old from Cotton, Suffolk, said: 'I heard about it last night it was a complete shock. I have been told that he was riding a lawnmower and it went into the pond. I don't know much more about how it happened. 'But knowing the sort of person Richard was I am not surprised. He was a very hands on guy and would do that kind of work. 'We used to play football together and we used to work together at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). I worked in the sales office he was a chemist and then a waste environmental manager before he retired about three of four years ago. 'He was just a really nice bloke. The club used to be part of ICI but we wanted to make it independent and Richard was heavily involved on that. 'He did so much for the club, he's really going to be missed. He's left us in a bit of a pickle really.' Liam Cracknell, 47, a lorry driver, who lives on the same street as Mr Clements, said: 'I heard about it this morning, it's really sad. 'I think the whole village will be shocked about it. 'I heard he drowned after the piece of machinery fell on top of him. 'Obviously it's very, very sad you don't wish that on anybody, but this isn't the first time we have had something like this happen. 'A couple of years ago we had a mam die in a pond and we had a young girl die in a bath after she had an epileptic fit. 'That's three drownings in one village which is the really strange. Obviously they are not connected but it's a very strange coincidence.' The incident occurred at about 5.15pm yesterday in the rural Suffolk village of Wattisham (above). Police said there were\u00a0no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death and a file is being prepared for the coroner . Another neighbour, who didn't want to be named, added: 'I was here at the time and I saw all the ambulance and fire engines. 'It's a real shock to hear what actually happened. I knew him to say hello to he seemed like a really nice bloke. He was very well known round here and really liked. It's such a shame.' East of England Ambulance Service said Mr Clements suffered a heart attack and, despite the best efforts of emergency services, died at the scene. Suffolk Police was unable to confirm whether he lived at the rural farmhouse but said he wasn't a contracted worker brought in to maintain the land. The force said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and said a file was being prepared for the coroner. A spokesman said: 'Police were called to address in Bildeston Road at Wattisham around 5.15pm yesterday to reports that a ride-on lawnmower was upside down in a pond in a private garden. 'A man, believed to be in his 60s, who had been driving the lawnmower was pulled from the vehicle and attempts were made to resuscitate him, however he was pronounced deceased at the scene.' An air ambulance and hazardous response team were sent to the incident. The tragic incident comes just two years after a man died in similar circumstances in the rural village. Michael Bradwel, 52, was working to restore a farmhouse in the village in May 2013 and died after being found unconscious in a pond within the grounds of a property.",

The Gunners are now a point behind second-placed Manchester City with eight games remaining. Olivier Giroud (left) and Arsene Wenger are the Premier League Player and Manager of the Month .

'I'm really pleased with it,' Giroud told Arsenal's official website. 'I would like to thank my team-mates and of course the fans, because it's a collective sport and I couldn't do it on my own. 'It's a great honour to have been selected as Player of the Month, especially because we wanted to bounce back from the Champions League disappointment. 'That's what we've done and we've come back really strongly. We all want to finish strongly and this award will give me more confidence for the following games.' Kane also fired five goals in four appearances for Mauricio Pochettino's side in March, including his first ever Premier League hat-trick when Spurs beat Leicester City 4-3 at White Hart Lane. But it was Giroud who took the honours after finding the back of the net in all of Arsenal's league encounters.

    "source": "Andreas Lubitz appears to have researched suicide methods, cockpit door security and medical treatment before crashing the Germanwings plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board . Killer pilot Andreas Lubitz researched suicide methods and cockpit door security before crashing his Germanwings plane into the French Alps, it emerged last night. German prosecutors said an examination of a tablet computer found at his apartment revealed he had recently used internet search terms such as cockpit doors and their security, and suicide methods. The revelations came hours after it was reported that Lubitz told doctors he was on sick leave rather than flying. It also emerged that the 27-year-old was prescribed an anti-anxiety drug so strong doctors have to warn patients of the increased risk of suicide. People who use Lorazapam are advised not to drive a car, let alone fly a commercial jetliner. Medical experts say it can also increase the risk of self-harm at the start of treatment. Prosecutors yesterday announced that the second black box from the flight had been found. It was said to be in a good condition and was likely to yield more information. Investigators believe Lubitz locked his captain out of the A320\u2019s cockpit on March 24 and deliberately crashed the plane, killing all 150 people on board \u2013 possibly because of suicidal tendencies or fears he may lose his pilot\u2019s licence. Citing sources from the investigation, German newspaper Bild reported that he sometimes lied to doctors that he was off work and wanted to get better so he could fly again. It said he gave them information about his job as a pilot and his employer, Germanwings, but concealed that he was still working. He was apparently more stable in recent years, but in the past few weeks had reportedly seen doctors three times for depression and an eye doctor over fears he was losing his sight. Bild said it discovered that he was prescribed drugs, including the sedative Lorazepam, to combat to range of disorders. Evidence: Police carry a computer out of the house Lubitz shared with his parents in Montabaur, Germany, two days after the disaster. Investigators have also found a tablet computer which revealed a search history from March 16 to March 23 that included\u00a0medical treatment, suicide methods and cockpit door security .

The second black box from the Germanwings plane, seen  during a press conference of the French prosecutor in Marseille, was found  'usable' condition yesterday . A member of the Dog Services of the French Gendarmerie carries a dog as he prepares to visit the crash site . The first black box voice recorder from the Germanwings flight that was recovered last week and revealed Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane. The second has now also been retrieved from the wreckage . Families of those killed in the Alps crash  are likely to receive vastly different payouts depending on their nationality, where they bought the ticket and how much they earned, lawyers said today. Claims can be made either where the ticket was purchased, in the home country of the airline, at courts in the passenger's destination or in the passenger's home country. But in air crashes, the amounts awarded for pain and suffering vary by country\u00a0even though they may all have shared the same fate. Victims from the U.S. tend to receive higher payouts, followed by Europeans and Asians. Lawyer James Healy-Pratt at Stewarts Law LLP, which is advising families of those killed in the Malaysian Air disasters last year, said British parents who lose an adult child can expect compensation of around \u00a320,000, while American parents could expect \u00a31.5million. Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said on Wednesday that the airline would provide assistance to the families of those killed 'for as long as help is needed'. Investigators have found mobile phones amid the wreckage but they are yet to be thoroughly examined . Lorazepam belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines which  treat a variety of conditions including anxiety, sleeping problems and other mental health disorders. Patients with psychiatric issues are warned it could lead to changes in behaviour. Worryingly, this can include an increased risk of suicide, particularly in the early stages of treatment. Users are also advised to get at least seven hours continuous sleep or it can cause memory loss  from the time you wake up to the time the effects of the drug have worn off. Due to its strong soporific effect, it can hamper your ability to drive or operate machinery. Source: NHS Choices . A pharmacologist said: \u2018It is prescribed to combat anxiety, tension and sleep disorders. Whether you should fly a plane or even drive is questionable.\u2019 Doctors had recently found no sign that Lubitz intended to hurt himself or others. But he was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash. German transport minister Alexander Dobrindt yesterday announced the setting up of the task force that would look at, among other things, whether extra checks on the mental health of pilots should be introduced. Investigators continue to deny reports that mobile phone footage from on board the jet had emerged. They say they have found phones amid the wreckage but the devices have yet to be thoroughly examined. Special mountain troops are continuing to search for personal belongings. French forensics experts confirmed yesterday they had identified DNA strands from all 150 victims of the crash. Rescue workers examine wreckage at the site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 crash in the French Alps . Andreas Lubitz exploited post-9/11 safety mechanisms to carry out his murderous plan. He waited for his captain, Patrick Sondenheimer, to leave the flight deck and go to the toilet before commanding the Airbus A320 to descend. Once out of the cockpit, the door locked automatically. Ironically, this auto-lock feature, which led to Lubitz having sole control of the plane, was introduced as a way of improving flight safety in the wake of 9/11. Scroll down for video . The Airbus A-320 is fitted with a safety system, pictured, to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck . Lubitz was sitting in this cockpit, pictured, when he commanded the jet to crash into the Alps at 400mph . The Airbus A320 is fitted with a locking mechanism to prevent unauthorised access to the flight deck while the aircraft is in flight.\u00a0The door was also specially strengthened, to prevent someone from being able to barge their way through. The safety systems were improved in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks where hijackers were able to gain access to the cockpit and take over the aircraft. Access to the cockpit door on the Germanwings Airbus A320 (like the one above) can be disabled from inside the flight deck to prevent hijacking . In normal flight, the door to the flight is closed and locked. Cabin crew can use a code and gain access to the flight deck. Entry is controlled by the flight crew, in case of a possible hijack attempt. The Cockpit Door Locking System (CDLS) according to the flight manual 'provides a means of electrically locking and unlocking the cockpit door'. The CDLS is located in the central pedestal between both pilots and has a toggle switch which controls the door. They also have a CCTV camera so they can see who is seeking access, and if they are under any form of duress. Pilots can restrict access to the flight deck although cabin crew can gain entry in an emergency. However, this emergency access can be over-ridden by the pilot for between five to 20 minutes. The limited time to keep the door closed is itself a safety feature, in case the flight crew become incapacitated. After the predetermined time, the keypad on the outside of the cockpit door will become operational again, unless the pilot actively restricts access again. Also the cockpit door has several other safety features in case of a sudden decompression which will cause the door to open. The pilot has to flick one simple switch, pictured, \u00a0to lock the cabin door for between five and 20 minutes .",

    "source": "David Cameron was upstaged by a six-year-old school girl today after trying to unveil a new Tory education policy. The Prime Minister visited a primary school near Bolton to unveil the party's latest proposal to improve education standards, after announcing that under a future Tory government children who achieve poor SATs results will be forced to resit them in secondary school. As Mr Cameron tried to help school pupil Lucy Howarth read a story about 'Prince Ronald' the youngster pulled a series of funny faces before resting her head on the table after struggling with a tricky passage. Scroll down for video . David Cameron helps with a reading lesson with pupils Lucy Howarth, 6, and Will Spibey, 5, left, during a visit to Sacred Heart RC primary school in Westhoughton near Bolton today . The PM wants to see children who get poor Sats results  forced to resit them in secondary school . The Prime Minister shared a joke  with six-year-old Lucy at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School near Bolton . The Prime Minister appeared completely taken with the youngster who showed no signs of being fazed by his attendance. Mr Cameron had planned to use the classroom visit to unveil his plan, which he said was intended to inject 'more rigour and zero tolerance of failure and mediocrity' in schools. The resit plan would mean 100,000 pupils taking a new test in English and maths during their first year after leaving primary school. The proposal would be implemented next year and is aimed at making sure that pupils have not already fallen too far behind at the beginning of secondary school. Pupils who did not get good grades in the Sats tests taken by 11-year-olds in primary school would have to retake a test during their first year after moving up to secondary school. In last year's tests, 79 per cent of pupils achieved the expected grades in reading, writing and maths. The Tories claim that, too often, pupils who have slipped behind by this stage never catch up. Among those who fail to make the grade at the age of 11, they say only 7% go on to get five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Children would be forced to retake a test in maths and English, marked by teachers rather than external examiners. There could be up to two retakes, in the spring or summer terms, and the number of pupils who had failed the retakes would be published as part of the league table data. The PM made the announcement in Lancashire today with the Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (centre) Mr Cameron  chatted with  pupils outside at the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School near Bolton . Pupils with special needs would not have to take the resits. Mr Cameron said: 'There is no job that doesn't require English and maths, and this is about making sure every child gets the best start in life and that our country can compete in the world.' Education Secretary Nicky Morgan added: 'We know that the biggest predictor of success at GCSE is whether young people have mastered the basics at age 11. That means if we fail to get it right for young people at the start of secondary school they'll struggle for the rest of their time in education.' Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt dismissed the proposal as 'desperate' Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said dismissed the announcement as a 'a desperate attempt by the Tories to try to overshadow their failures on school standards'. Mr Hunt said: 'On their watch, 1.6 million pupils are being educated in schools that are rated lower than 'good' by Ofsted. And as a result of David Cameron's unqualified teachers policy, more than 400,000 pupils are being taught by unqualified teachers. 'Labour has a better plan for education. We will ensure that every teacher is qualified or working towards qualified teacher status and introduce a new master teacher status to raise the standing of the profession. That is how we improve education for every child, in every classroom,' he said. The Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws said the Tories had 'no credibility' on education because of their planned spending cuts after the election. He said: ' You simply can't improve schools by starving them of resources and burdening them with the bureaucracy of additional testing. 'The way to make sure every child starts secondary school achieving a good level of Maths and English is to invest in their early years and primary education, recruiting great teachers and getting extra support to the children who most need it. 'That's why we need to protect the education budget, in real terms, including schools, nurseries and colleges. 'The Tories are trying to paper over the cracks in their scorched earth education plans that would undo the progress of the last five years.' Malcolm Trobe, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders union, warned the tests could become a bureaucratic nightmare. He said: 'It is important that the results of these tests are diagnostic and used to support the work of the teachers and do not become yet another performance indicator on which to measure schools.'",

    "source": "An American company claims to have invented a 'teabag' that can turn an ordinary pint of lager into a craft beer the same way  hot water is turned into brew . The Hop Theory 'beer-bag' contains a blend of hops, fruit peels and natural spices, and promises to turn light beer into craft after just two minutes of steeping. However, despite nearly reaching its crowd-funding target, the project has been criticised by professional breweries as being misleading about what constitutes as 'craft beer'. Scroll down for video . Transformation: The Hop Theory sachets promises to turn lager into craft beer in just two minutes . Hop Theory, based in Maryland, is nearing its $25,000 target on crowd-funding site Kickstarter to produce its first blend, claiming it will turn lager into 'craft beer' in just two to four minutes. Bobby Gattuso, who founded the company as a biology student in 2013,  hopes to revolutionise beer drinking. 'Craft beer excels in taste but it's expensive. Light beer is cost effective and low in calories but lacks flavour, and with Hop Theory, an average beer becomes craft.' Emily Williamson of independent brewery\u00a0Cheddar Ales in Somerset, England, is sceptical to the idea of 'tea bag' beer. 'Firstly,\u00a0adding hops, flavouring herbs, peels during the brewing process is about stabilizing those ingredients to make them safe for consumption. 'Secondly, and most importantly, the boiling phase is when your wort (the unfermented liquid extracted from the mashing process) concentrates, and flavours, aroma and balance are carefully adjusted  to create the complexity people of our beer drinking generation are after.' New drink: After a short infusion of two minutes, the blend of hops, dried fruit and spices will have changed the taste of a lighter lager into that on par with a craft beer . New ideas: The Relativity blend contains dried and ground orange peel, Cascade hops and ground coriander seeds, and is set to hit the market this summer . Ms Williamson adds that the claim that the Hop Theory sachets can make a lager taste like a craft beer could also 'mislead people'. 'To add a sachet to a pre-balanced, pre-made beer will only add a glimmer of the flavours available in traditionally made beers. 'For example our latest brew, Firewitch Spicy Farmhouse Saison, has had citrus peel in it for over two weeks, which really allows for a multitude of flavours to release into the brew. 'So, without tasting the product, I can only guess that it won't add anywhere near the depth of flavour that the actual brewing process can achieve as it's not inherent to the structure.' Hannah Rhodes, founder of Hiver beers, says: 'Good quality beer is more expensive because avoiding shortcuts and brewing naturally takes time, normally 3 to 6 times longer than that of it's mainstream competitors.' 'Here at Hiver, the honeys we source are fermented at the start of the process along with the cereals, and by not adding honey for flavouring at the end, you get a lovely crisp and refreshing finish and not something that's sweet or cloying or artificial. 'The entrepreneurs behind the Hop Theory have spotted a great opportunity and I honestly think, anything that encourages people to think more seriously about what they eat and drink and experiment with taste, flavour and quality, is a good thing, so I wish them the best of luck.' Their words are echoed by Durham Atkinson, owner of London craft beer pub and brewery Hops & Glory. 'In all honesty, I am not convinced that the attention to the brewing process in craft beer can be outdone in a sachet. 'The countless hours brewers spend watching their boil, trying and testing their beers and tweaking recipes and temperatures countless times I doubt can be solved by this product. I would however give it a go to see if a tasteless lager is improved by the sachet.' Reusable: Each sachet can be used in up to four beers, so keeps both costs and calories down . Guide: A graphic from Mr Gattuso's Kickstarter campaign describes how to use the Hop Theory sachets . Hop Theory's first blend Relativity contains dried and ground orange peel, Cascade hops and ground coriander seeds, with another four blends planned for this year - raspberry, pumpkin, double IPA and peach. Each 5g Hop Theory sachet can transfuse up to four beers, so one bag could keep the drinker going for a session at the pub. The first infusion will take between two and four minutes, but once the bag is wet, any further uses will only take about 30 seconds to transfuse, Mr Gattuso says. 'We have been meticulously fine-tuning the perfect balance of ingredients to create our first blend and are finally ready to begin production. 'Hop Theory is here to add customisation to the beer industry. 'There's only five calories in each sachet, so it improves a light beer without adding pounds or going penniless. 'It took a long time to create the perfect blend but finally Relativity was born and as our first blend, we think we nailed it. It is delicious and refreshing. 'No longer will you have to settle for what's being served or dream about the beer you could be having. 'We simply want to to give everyone control over how their beer tastes.' The first beerbags will be delivered in July this year, and 12 sachets cost $14.95 (\u00a310).",

Of 10 Barclays Premier League matches kicking off at 12.00, 12.45 or 1.30, Spurs have won two - against QPR last August and Arsenal in February - collecting nine points out of a possible 30. Six of the matches followed Europa League games on Thursday nights, and Spurs lost four of those and drew the other two. Harry Kane is pictured celebrating for Tottenham after scoring in their victory at Newcastle last week . Christian Eriksen is mobbed by his  team-mates after netting Tottenham's second goal at Newcastle . Pochettino, whose side play his former club Southampton at 12.45 at St Mary's on Saturday, said: 'Maybe this is a coincidence. Or maybe this is because we play Thursday around Europe and have no recovery. 'I don't know. It's difficult to understand why. Maybe it's because we have played Thursday night and spent a lot of energy.' Spurs have fared better in later kick-offs. 'Maybe three or four hours more of recovery is better,' Pochettino said. 'That can affect that.' The Argentine dismissed the prospect of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris, who could return after missing three matches with a knee injury, seeking a move if Spurs miss out on the top four this term. 'Hugo wants to play the Champions League here for Tottenham and I think this is a rumour and nothing true,' added the Spurs boss, whose only definite absentee is Kyle Walker. 'Hugo is very happy here and wants to reach the Champions League with Tottenham. This is his dream.' Hugo Lloris will stay at Tottenham even if the club fail to qualify for the Champions League, says Pochettino . Pochettino is looking forward to returning to St Mary's with Spurs after leaving Southampton last summer. The 43-year-old headed a host of departures - including key players and the backroom staff - leaving successor Ronald Koeman to rebuild. 'We finished last season eighth in the table,' Pochettino said, recalling his time at Southampton. 'We played very well and it was the end the project of five years with Nicola Cortese and Markus Liebherr. 'We stabilised the club in the Premier League and top 10 and I'm very happy. It was good for Southampton because I love the people of Southampton, the players. 'Koeman has continued to develop the project, or a new project, and it's a fantastic job and he deserves the praise.' Pochettino is uncertain what reception to expect. 'I don't expect nothing special,' he said. 'I love the people at the club, the players, because in one and a half years I enjoyed a lot because it was one of the best periods of my life.'",

    "source": "(CNN)James Holmes made his introduction to the world in a Colorado cinema filled with spectators watching a midnight showing of the new Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" in June 2012. The moment became one of the deadliest shootings in U.S. history. Holmes is accused of opening fire on the crowd, killing 12 people and injuring or maiming 70 others in Aurora, a suburb of Denver. Holmes appeared like a comic book character: He resembled the Joker, with red-orange hair, similar to the late actor Heath Ledger's portrayal of the villain in an earlier Batman movie, authorities said. But Holmes was hardly a cartoon. Authorities said he wore body armor and carried several guns, including an AR-15 rifle, with lots of ammo. He also wore a gas mask. Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors aren't swayed and will seek the death penalty. Opening statements in his trial are scheduled to begin Monday. Holmes admits to the shootings but says he was suffering \"a psychotic episode\" at the time,  according to court papers filed in July 2013 by the state public defenders, Daniel King and Tamara A. Brady. Evidence \"revealed thus far in the case supports the defense's position that Mr. Holmes suffers from a severe mental illness and was in the throes of a psychotic episode when he committed the acts that resulted in the tragic loss of life and injuries sustained by moviegoers on July 20, 2012,\" the public defenders wrote. Holmes no longer looks like a dazed Joker, as he did in his first appearance before a judge in 2012. He appeared dramatically different in January when jury selection began for his trial: 9,000 potential jurors were summoned for duty, described as one of the nation's largest jury calls. Holmes now has a cleaner look, with a mustache, button-down shirt and khaki pants. In January, he had a beard and eyeglasses. If this new image sounds like one of an academician, it may be because Holmes, now 27, once was one. Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant. Yet for all his learning, Holmes apparently lacked the capacity to command his own mind, according to the case against him. A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate. That panel is made up of 12 jurors and 12 alternates. They are 19 women and five men, and almost all are white and middle-aged. The trial could last until autumn. When jury summonses were issued in January, each potential juror stood a 0.2% chance of being selected, District Attorney George Brauchler told the final jury this month. He described the approaching trial as \"four to five months of a horrible roller coaster through the worst haunted house you can imagine.\" The jury will have to render verdicts on each of the 165 counts against Holmes, including murder and attempted murder charges. Meanwhile, victims and their relatives are challenging all media outlets \"to stop the gratuitous use of the name and likeness of mass killers, thereby depriving violent individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave,\" the No Notoriety group says. They are joined by victims from eight other mass shootings in recent U.S. history. Raised in central coastal California and in San Diego, James Eagan Holmes is the son of a mathematician father noted for his work at the FICO firm that provides credit scores and a registered nurse mother, according to the U-T San Diego newspaper. Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said. His childhood classmates remember him as a clean-cut, bespectacled boy with an \"exemplary\" character who \"never gave any trouble, and never got in trouble himself,\" The Salinas Californian reported. His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Pe\u00f1asquitos, which a neighbor described as \"kind of like Mayberry,\" the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended Westview High School, which says its school district sits in \"a primarily middle- to upper-middle-income residential community.\" There, Holmes ran cross-country, played soccer and later worked at a biotechnology internship at the Salk Institute and Miramar College, which attracts academically talented students. By then, his peers described him as standoffish and a bit of a wiseacre, the San Diego newspaper said. Holmes attended college fairly close to home, in a neighboring area known as Southern California's \"inland empire\" because it's more than an hour's drive from the coast, in a warm, low-desert climate. He entered the University of California, Riverside, in 2006 as a scholarship student. In 2008 he was a summer camp counselor for disadvantaged children, age 7 to 14, at Camp Max Straus, run by Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters of Los Angeles. He graduated from UC Riverside in 2010 with the highest honors and a bachelor's degree in neuroscience. \"Academically, he was at the top of the top,\" Chancellor Timothy P. White said. He seemed destined for even higher achievement. By 2011, he had enrolled as a doctoral student in the neuroscience program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, the largest academic health center in the Rocky Mountain region. The doctoral in neuroscience program attended by Holmes focuses on how the brain works, with an emphasis on processing of information, behavior, learning and memory. Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health. The grant rewards outstanding neuroscientists who will make major contributions to neurobiology. A syllabus that listed Holmes as a student at the medical school shows he was to have delivered a presentation about microRNA biomarkers. But Holmes struggled, and his own mental health took an ominous turn. In March 2012, he told a classmate he wanted to kill people, and that he would do so \"when his life was over,\" court documents said. Holmes was \"denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor,\" according to court documents. About that time, Holmes was a patient of University of Colorado psychiatrist Lynne Fenton. Fenton was so concerned about Holmes' behavior that she mentioned it to her colleagues, saying he could be a danger to others, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, citing sources with knowledge of the investigation. Fenton's concerns surfaced in early June, sources told the Denver station. Holmes began to fantasize about killing \"a lot of people\" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation. Holmes' psychiatrist contacted several members of a \"behavioral evaluation and threat assessment\" team to say Holmes could be a danger to others, the station reported. At issue was whether to order Holmes held for 72 hours to be evaluated by mental health professionals, the station reported. \"Fenton made initial phone calls about engaging the BETA team\" in \"the first 10 days\" of June, but it \"never came together\" because in the period Fenton was having conversations with team members, Holmes began the process of dropping out of school, a source told KMGH. Defense attorneys have rejected the prosecution's assertions that Holmes was barred from campus. Citing statements from the university, Holmes' attorneys have argued that his access was revoked because that's normal procedure when a student drops enrollment. What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed. In the months before the shooting, he bought four weapons and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition, authorities said. Police said he also booby-trapped his third-floor apartment with explosives, but police weren't fooled. After Holmes was caught in the cinema parking lot immediately after the shooting, bomb technicians went to the apartment and neutralized the explosives. No one was injured at the apartment building. Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court. The number he called can be used to get in contact with faculty members during off hours, Brady said. Court documents have also revealed that investigators have obtained text messages that Holmes exchanged with someone before the shooting. That person was not named, and the content of the texts has not been made public. According to The New York Times, Holmes sent a text message to a fellow graduate student, a woman, about two weeks before the shooting. She asked if he had left Aurora yet, reported the newspaper, which didn't identify her. No, he had two months left on his lease, Holmes wrote back, according to the Times. He asked if she had heard of \"dysphoric mania,\" a form of bipolar disorder marked by the highs of mania and the dark and sometimes paranoid delusions of major depression. The woman asked if the disorder could be managed with treatment. \"It was,\" Holmes wrote her, according to the Times. But he warned she should stay away from him \"because I am bad news,\" the newspaper reported. It was her last contact with Holmes. After the shooting, Holmes' family issued a brief statement: \"Our hearts go out to those who were involved in this tragedy and to the families and friends of those involved,\" they said, without giving any information about their son. Since then, prosecutors have refused to offer a plea deal to Holmes. For Holmes, \"justice is death,\" said Brauchler, the district attorney. In December, Holmes' parents, who will be attending the trial, issued another statement: They asked that their son's life be spared and that he be sent to an institution for mentally ill people for the rest of his life, if he's found not guilty by reason of insanity. \"He is not a monster,\" Robert and Arlene Holmes wrote, saying the death penalty is \"morally wrong, especially when the condemned is mentally ill.\" \"He is a human being gripped by a severe mental illness,\" the parents said. The matter will be settled by the jury. CNN's Ana Cabrera and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report from Denver.",

And any parent who has tried this will know how tiring it can be when you then have to carry your child around once you arrive at your destination. A Swedish firm is hoping to make getting around with a young child easier - and save your aching arms - by introducing the bike seat that doubles up as a stroller.

The product will launch on Kickstarter next week but prices are not yet known . Called P\u00e5hoj, it clips onto the back of a standard bike using a specially-designed attachment. A child, up to a height of 3.2ft (1 metres), is then strapped into the seat in an almost vertical position.

Christian Benteke's hat-trick earned a draw for Villa, with his last goal coming just seven minutes before full-time, and within five minutes of what had looked like a winner from Charlie Austin. Matt Phillips had earlier given QPR the lead in the first half but taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point at Villa Park. Tony Fernandes spoke of his despair after his Queens Park Rangers team twice threw away a lead . Fernandes, Rangers chairman, was watching the 3-3 draw at Villa Park from his iPhone away from the game . Taking all three points wasn't to be for the relegation-threatened visitors and they had to settle for a point . And Fernandes, currently in Malaysia, spoke of his experience of a variety of emotions while watching the game from the other side of the world. 'It's a strange thing thus QPR love,' he tweeted. 'I went to bed at 1 in the morning. I got up exactly at 2.45 am. No alarm. My heart knew it's QPR time. 'I watched the game on my iPhone all kinds of emotions. Despair, disappointment, joy, but most important pride. 4 points from two away games.' Fernandes revealed that Richard Dunne and Leroy Fer could return for Sunday's visit of Chelsea and that Yun Suk-young would also return after that game. The character of QPR's Clint Hill and Chris Ramsey were praised by their club's chairman on Twitter . Charlie Austin looked like he might have scored a late winner for QPR but Christian Benteke equalised . Clint Hill scored his first Barclays Premier League goal for Rangers' second, and Fernandes was delighted with the display of the veteran centre back, even if he did fail to get to grips with the prolific Benteke. He also reserved praise for manager Chris Ramsey . 'Clint hill typified our fighting spirit,' he posted. 'As I've always said players playing for the badge and Chris Ramsey what a pro.' Finally, Fernandes posted some cryptic tweets as to his own future at the club, perhaps hinting that he would be leaving. Hill had equalised in the second half after hosts Villa led 2-1 at the break courtesy of Benteke's two goals . Matt Phillips opened the scoring for Rangers but they found themselves pegged back by brilliant Benteke . Fernandes is also Global CEO of AirAsia, the airline that saw\u00a0flight QZ8501 go missing late last year. 'It's been a tough three months since December 28th. Abuse, tragedy, close friends gone but I never stopped believing in all that we do,' Fernandes said. 'The decision on my future has been made. 6 games 18 points. Never stop believing rangers fans. Les also a hero. Never stop believing.' QPR stay inside the relegation zone but moved up to 18th place with the draw. They face Chelsea at Loftus Road on Sunday in what is sure to be another occasion to play on supporters', and the owners', emotions.",

A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor\u00a0Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of\u00a0Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order.

This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks.

Mr Standen said: \u2018The fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years.\u2019 The scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline, but interest in the programme, based on Winston Graham\u2019s Poldark historical novels, set in the 18th century, is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost.

Estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in Cornwall since Poldark began airing last month . Smuggling was rife in the 18th century, when Poldark is set, and Cornwall's coast is full of hidden coves and tucked-away inlets. It was popular with smugglers because it had a long expanse of rocky, virtually uninhabited coast. With few revenue men to patrol it, goods like tea, brandy, rum and tobacco were smuggled in. All four of Fowey's public toilets are out of service just weeks before summer . Poldark fans and thousands of other holidaymakers who are planning to visit a popular seaside town in Cornwall may have nowhere to go when nature calls. Located in the heart of Poldark country, the town of Fowey is locked in a bizarre and long-running wrangle over public toilets. All four of the main public conveniences in Fowey \u2013 where a Poldark exhibition is being planned in May \u2013 are closed and with the summer tourist season fast approaching, there\u2019s no sign of the wee wrangle being resolved. The town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from Cornwall Council at the start of 2013. But more than two years later, the details of the transfer of ownership of three of them - Caffa Mill, the main car park and Readymoney Cove \u2013 are still being worked out by the county council while the fourth block, at the Town Quay, is shut for refurbishment. Town clerk Sally Vincent said: \u2018There is nothing more the town council can do to push it on... it is still in the legal loop. \u2018I am hopeful it will be completed soon. \u2018The town council is really pleased to be able to take on the ownership of the toilets. \u2018As a town council we feel we need to get the Town Quay toilets up and running and then go from there. It's important that Fowey has these facilities.\u2019 The Town Quay toilets were already owned by the town council but leased to Cornwall Council, which has meant the handover could be completed more quickly. Refurbishment work started last week and it is hoped they will be open within eight weeks, with the toilet for the disabled being available to use while work is done on the others. When they reopen, visitors will have to pay 20p per use to offset the cost to the town council of running them. Mrs Vincent added: \u2018The cost of running toilets is astronomical. \u2018The town council simply doesn't have the money to do it for nothing so it was felt that if we charge 20p it would be something towards it.\u2019 Cornwall Council figures suggest it will cost a minimum of \u00a326,000 a year to run the four sets of toilets, with the town having to cover insurance costs and business rates as well as cleaning, maintenance and consumables. Until the transfer of ownership on the three blocks at the main car park, Readymoney Cove and Caffa Mill, is completed, the responsibility for opening the toilets will rest with Cornwall Council.",

Each year thousands of homeless pooches facing euthanasia - some hours away from death - get loaded on planes and flown to new homes in places where shelters are experiencing shortages. Groups such as California-based Wings of Rescue or South Carolina-based Pilots N Paws recruit pilots to volunteer their planes, fuel and time. The two non-profits say their concept has been a roaring success with the numbers increasing year-on-year. It's estimated that more than 4 million U.S. pets are euthanized every year. Scroll down for video . Pilot pooch, do you read me? Each year thousands of homeless dogs facing euthanasia - some hours from death - get loaded on planes and flown to new homes in places where shelters are experiencing shortages . Both pilot groups encourage spaying and neutering as a solution but know that airlifts will increase every year as they become more visible and the number of needy dogs grows. States such as California, Georgia and South Carolina typically have too many dogs in shelters, while places such as Washington, Oregon, New York, New Jersey and Florida need more pets to satisfy demand. To solve the location conundrum, pilots fire up their engines. In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, retirees want smaller dogs, which are easier to take care of but a tough find in the area with the high demand. So, the Kootenai Humane Society orders a planeload of dogs under 16 pounds every month, or more than 1,000 animals in the last 16 months, executive director Debbie Jeffrey said. Window seat: Groups such as California-based Wings of Rescue or South Carolina-based Pilots N Paws, recruit pilots to volunteer their planes, fuel and time .

Saved from peril: It's estimated that more than 4 million U.S. pets are euthanized every year . 'It's just been a real success. As fast as they come in, they are adopted,' she said. The successes increase as more pilots sign up to help. 'We have seen the number of animals rescued go up every year since we started in 2008,' said Kate Quinn, executive director of Pilots N Paws. The group's 5,000-plus pilots have flown more than 15,000 dogs to new homes each of the past two years, relocating more than 75,000 animals over the last seven years, she said. And the numbers keep rising. Growing trend: Wings of Rescue and Pilots N Paws encourage spaying and neutering as a solution but know that airlifts will increase every year as they become more visible and the number of needy dogs grows . Snuggled up: It's reported that most pooches sleep in the air and don't get sick . 'Pilots love a reason to fly. They love making these flights,' Quinn said, adding that all dogs have to be spayed or neutered, microchipped and vaccinated before they take off. Yehuda Netanel, founder and president of Wings of Rescue, says business has doubled each of the past four-and-a-half years. He started as the lone pilot who rescued 300 dogs, and now the group expects to fly 7,000 pets in 2015, he said. The pilot of 27 years will charter planes to move dogs if there aren't enough private planes, meaning flights cost about $80 per dog. Netanel and his 28 pilots are preparing to take flight this weekend with 250 dogs from San Bernardino, 150 from Bakersfield and smaller numbers from other locations. Packing them in: Kootenai Humane Society orders a planeload of dogs under 16 pounds every month, or more than 1,000 animals in the last 16 months . Puppy-dog eyes: 'We have seen the number of animals rescued go up every year since we started in 2008,' said Kate Quinn, executive director of Pilots N Paws . Pilots Kale and Anj Garcia of Seattle will be in San Bernardino to bring as many as 50 dogs back to Washington state in their seven-passenger Cessna 414. The couple have flown 16 missions for Wings of Rescue. Most dogs sleep during the flight, and only a few have had air sickness, said Anj Garcia, who will take each one out of its crate and cuddle it during the journey. The flights allowed Cathy Parker of Coeur d'Alene to find her dogs: Bella, a poodle-Chihuahua mix, and Sidney, a poodle-Pomeranian mix, who Wings of Rescue delivered from different shelters about nine months apart. 'They've been a real good match for each other and me,' she said.

    "source": "The vaccine, known as RTS,S, took 30 years to develop but it is now hoped it can be used to save millions of lives . A new jab against malaria could prevent millions of cases, scientists claim. Researchers say the vaccine, which has just completed the final stages of testing, could make a \u2018substantial contribution\u2019 to controlling the disease. Drug firm GlaxoSmithKline has applied for a licence from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the RTS,S vaccine. The news is significant because RTS,S is the first malaria vaccine to reach advanced trials. Tests were carried out on 15,500 toddlers and babies in sub-Saharan Africa. Among those who had three doses of RTS,S and a booster shot, the number of clinical cases of malaria \u2013 those confirmed by a doctor \u2013 was reduced by 36 per cent after four years. But the protection waned over time, boosters worked less well than the initial dose and the vaccine was not as effective in younger children, a report in The Lancet journal says. Scientists have worked on the vaccine for more than 20 years \u2013 at a cost of more than \u00a3330million, but experts say there is a long way to go. There is no licensed vaccine against malaria anywhere in the world and researchers say they are hopeful the results will be sufficient for RTS,S to gain a licence from the EMA.The World Health Organisation could then recommend its use by October this year. In the trials, an average of 1,363 cases of clinical malaria were prevented over four years for every 1,000 children vaccinated, and 1,774 cases in those who also received a booster. Over three years, an average 558 cases were averted for every 1,000 infants vaccinated, and 983 cases in those also given a booster dose. Professor Brian Greenwood, the study\u2019s author and professor of clinical tropical medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \u2018Despite the falling efficacy over time, there is still a clear benefit from RTS,S. \u2018Given that there were an estimated 198million malaria cases in 2013, this level of efficacy potentially translates into millions of cases of malaria in children being prevented.\u2019 But he said he was \u2018disappointed\u2019 by the results of the clinical trials, adding: \u2018I hoped the vaccine would be more effective, but we were never going to end up with the success seen in measles vaccines, with 97 per cent efficacy.\u2019 The shot , which is designed to be used by children in Africa, could be approved by October, making it the first approved vaccine for the world's most deadly disease . The disease is difficult to treat because the malaria parasite has a complicated life cycle and has learned how to evade the human immune system over hundreds of years. The latest World Health Organisation figures show that of the 198million cases in 2013, 584,000 people died. Most victims are children in Africa, where one dies every minute. Currently, the most effective prevention measure is the use of mosquito nets. The trial involved 15,459 infants aged six to 12 weeks and children aged five to 17 months from Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. Bloodsucker: A mosquito.

The US  were beaten 3-2 as Williams and Alison Riske were thrashed 6-0 6-3 in the doubles rubber by Errani and Flavia Pennetta, meaning they were relegated to World Group II. American tennis star Serena Williams fought back to beat Italian Sara Errani in the Fed Cup play-off on Sunday . Tough weather conditions made it difficult for both players who had to keep on re-tossing their serves . Errani gave Williams a real scare but in the end the world No 1's power proved to be too much . 'Today has been a big eye opener,' Williams said afterwards.

    "source": "Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN)More than 4,600 people dead. More than 9,000 injured. Eight million affected across Nepal. One million children urgently in need of help. Those are the startling numbers that indicate the scale of the devastation from the huge earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on Saturday. And some of the grim figures are likely to get even worse as hopes of rescuing any more survivors diminish every hour. Heartbreaking scenes of suffering and loss are playing out across this shell-shocked nation as it reels from its deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years. As the country coped with the fallout of the quake, another natural disaster struck Tuesday afternoon in a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu, and up to 200 people were feared missing as a result of a landslide, a trekking association official said. It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details. Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need. In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake. By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday. As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents. Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara. \"We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain,\" said Ishan, the elder of the two. Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble. Kisnor Raj Giri, a 22-year-old man from Kathmandu who lost members of his extended family in the quake, said he was too scared to return home. He is camping out at the military grounds with thousands of others even though frequent rain has made the nights an ordeal. \"Many people are crying, sharing their hardships,\" he told CNN on Monday evening. The elements showed no mercy to the homeless masses on Tuesday as thunderstorms rumbled over Kathmandu. More bad weather is forecast for the region in the coming days. But in one piece of good news, Turkish and Chinese rescue crews helped pull free a 21-year-old man trapped under rubble near a city bus park in a 13-hour rescue operation. Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake . The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue. Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved. \"This is not the time to rest and lament,\" he said. \"This is the time to go out and save lives.\" Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche. \"Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help,\" he said. \"We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves.\" Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend. \"Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime,\" he said. Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239. Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths. Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas. \"We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up,\" Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. \"We cannot say by how much exactly.\" The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was \"on a war footing\" in its rescue and relief work. In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday. The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added. At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel. More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid. Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter. \"The biggest problem is reaching these villages,\" Matt Darvas, an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group World Vision, told CNN from Gorkha district, northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal struggles to cope with international aid . Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters. \"The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it,\" he said. \"We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them.\" Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed. The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains. Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million. At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs \"huge and urgent.\" \"The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts,\" he said. \"I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed.\" A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides. On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets. Social media posts from Nepal . Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter. They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly. Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them. \"Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there,\" Darvas said Monday. He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. Aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. High-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of Mount Everest, where the earthquake released deadly avalanches. Four U.S. citizens are among those who died on Everest, according to officials and relatives. Damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain, not to mention the overall situation in Nepal, means the climbing season is over for the year, climber Jim Davidson told CNN from the Everest base camp, where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain.

In the case of late 19th-century America, it was the 'escort card' - not to be confused with the explicit sort you might imagine today - but rather a comical printed card men would hand to women they found attractive. Collector Alan Mays\u00a0has unearthed a treasure trove of these vintage ice-breakers, which bear phrases such as: 'May I be permitted the blissful pleasure of escorting you home this evening?' Scroll down for video . Long before mobile phones came along - allowing single men and women to flirt behind the comfort of a glowing screen - shy love-seekers of the late 19th Century had to resort to other tactics (pictured) These comical printed cards were handed out by men  to women they found attractive . According to The Encyclopedia of Ephemera, there were two types of cards used in the 1870s and 1880s. One was referred to as the 'calling card' and would be used by gentleman to formally introduce themselves to new acquaintances - much like the modern business card. The second, as seen in Mr Mays' collection, was a novelty variety reserved for more casual encounters, namely men seeking the company of women, known as an 'escort card'. 'The device commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration,' the encyclopaedia states. 'Flirtatious and fun, the acquaintance card brought levity to what otherwise might have seemed a more formal proposal. 'A common means of introduction, it was never taken too seriously.' MessyNessyChic uncovered the collection, calling them an array of 'amusing pick-up lines you\u2019ve not likely heard before while waiting for your drink at the bar'. Rhyming couplets appeared to have been rather popular \u00a0in the 19th century according to these cards . The card commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration . Some were quite specific in their nature - albeit in a very polite way . Many of them have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern-day pick-up line. 'Dear Miss: You are sensible and good, you have all the charms of womanhood, your eyes resemble the stars above you, I shall be miserable if I can't love you,' reads one. 'May I see you home? Or will I have to set on the fence and watch you meander by?' reads another. Some were a little more down-to-business. 'I very much desire to make your acquaintance. If agreeable, please return this card, appointing time and place for interview, on the other side,' reads one. Another even blunter card bears the question: 'I am _ who the devil are you?' Several of the cards bear phrases such as: 'May I have the pleasure of seeing you home this evening? If so, keep this card; if not, please return.' Practical, if nothing else. Certain cards were short and to-the-point - including this 'may I. C. U. Home?' card . These 'escort cards' were seen as a more casual version of what we today regard as business cards . This blank card poses, 'Who the devil are you?' This man's intent is made crystal clear by its very title . Many of the cards have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern-day pick-up line . 'Two souls with but a single thought; two hearts that beat as one', reads this one . This card addresses its recipient as a 'dear creature' Many carried the disclaimer, 'If so, keep this card, if not, please return it'",

The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. Round up: The broadcast, hosted by a man with an American accent, boasted of ISIS victories during the day. Pictured: Fighting in Yarmouk was high on the agenda of the radio broadcast . It provided an overview of the militants activities in Iraq, Syria and Libya, discussing a range of topics \u00a0- including the alleged death of an ISIS commander in the Yarmouk refugee camp in the Syrian capital, Damascus, a suicide bombing in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk and mortar attacks on militias in Sirte, Libya. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. But the radio station is not the only option ISIS commanders are using to reach out to English-speakers: they already have a monthly propaganda magazine, Dabiq. The magazine - named after the Syrian town where a 'malahim', the equivalent to an Armageddon, in which the Muslims ultimately prevail - has so far issued eight editions, covering events like those in Paris and Sydney. It also boasts about some of its worst atrocities in the pages of the glossy booklet - which has even outlined a religious justification for slavery. Dominance?: Is the latest English medium to be used by ISIS - they already have an English magazine . Exactly why ISIS commanders have decided to branch out from print to radio now is not known, but it comes within days of it being revealed a new school of nursing in the militants' de facto capital Raqqa would only accept English-speaking applicants. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after they finish training. However, English's dominance around the globe is likely to mean it is the most convenient language to use when communicating with the estimated 20,000 fighters from 90 countries around the globe who have joined ISIS.",

US researchers discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. Plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change-resistant cocoa plants, which could boost plants\u2019 yields and the income of farmers. A gene involved in determining the melting point of cocoa butter could lead to the creation of new types of chocolate as well as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, scientists claim. \u00a0A stock image of chocolates is shown . More than five million cocoa farmers and their families depend on cocoa for their livelihoods around the world, where Cacao, Theobroma cacao L is cultivated in West Africa, Central and South America. The World Cocoa Foundation puts annual cocoa production worldwide at 3.8 million tons, which is valued at $11.8 billion (\u00a37.9 billion). Each cocoa pod has 40 seeds, which are composed of cocoa butter and used in the making of chocolate \u2013 and some drugs. Lead researcher Mark Guiltinan, professor of plant molecular biology at Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences said that cocoa butter with altered melting points may find new uses in specialty chocolates, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. US researchers discovered that a single gene called TcSAD1 is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter.\u00a0Plant geneticists say their finding could also lead to new varieties of climate change-resistant cocoa plants.\u00a0Cacao trees growing at a research facility in Ecuador are pictured . The world's largest confectionary producer, joined Mars in November in warning of a massive shortfall of chocolate, which could reach a million tonnes a year by 2020. Switzerland's Barry Callebaut Group said soaring demand has helped chocolate prices hit more than double what they were just eight years ago. Industry experts say the world is in its longest production shortfall for five decades. Cocoa prices rose by a quarter in a year to a peak in August of \u00a32,000 a tonne, nearing a February 2011 peak, Barry Callebaut said. Before the end of 2007 they had barely risen above \u00a31,300, according to figures from the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO). Barry Callebaut chief executive Juergen Steinemann said the hike was fuelled partly by a 'potential cocoa shortage' by 2020 - echoing previous warnings by Mars Chocolate that demand will outstrip supply. 'The global cocoa sector may suffer a one million metric ton shortfall by 2020 because of increasing economic and environmental pressures on cocoa farms around the world,' the firm said. 'Our long-term business depends on a sustainable supply of high quality cocoa, and we believe that securing cocoa\u2019s future begins with increasing yield for the smallholder farmers.' Disease and drought are partly to blame, but countries are also eating more sweets, particularly developing nations such as China. For example, a chocolate with a higher or lower melting point would be useful for production of chocolate with specific textures and specialty applications. 'The \"snap\" and \"melt\" of chocolate are two very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers, and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics,\u2019 Professor Guiltinan explained. \u2018Medical applications could include production of drug-delivery products with slower release of drugs than is possible with current cocoa-butter-based systems.\u2019 Professor Guiltinan was previously involved in research that first described the stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) gene family in the cocoa tree. Collaborators from the International Cocoa Genome Consortium sequenced the genome of the plant. Now Professor Guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - TcSAD1 \u2013 in the SAD family, is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. \u2018We used state-of-the-art plant science techniques to gain evidence for the role of the SAD1 gene in cocoa butter biosynthesis,\u2019 he explained. \u2018The other SAD genes appear to play other roles in the growth of the chocolate tree, such as flower and leaf development, where these fatty acids play important roles as key components of various membrane systems. \u2018This information can be used to develop biomarkers for screening and breeding of new cacao varieties with novel fatty acid compositions of cocoa butter.\u2019 This image shows cacao seeds after harvest. A mixture of lipids called cocoa butter makes up about half of each seed. The natural melting point of cocoa butter is close to human body temperature. This trait gives chocolate its melt-in-your-mouth texture and provides a creamy texture to lotions applied to the skin . Professor Guiltinan and his team have discovered that a single gene - TcSAD1 \u2013 in the SAD family, is responsible for the melting point of cocoa butter. He said the discovery could lead to new types of chocolate, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. A cocoa butter body scrub is shown left and a stock image of drugs, right . Cocoa butter consists of almost equal amounts of palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid. Its exact composition determines its melting temperature, which is very close to human body temperature. This is why chocolate feels smooth in the mouth and cosmetics containing cocoa butter have a creamy texture when applied to skin. \u2018During cacao seed development, large amounts of fatty acids are synthesised that are rich in saturated and monounsaturated lipids,\u2019 Professor Guiltinan said. \u2018An important part of this process is the activity of an enzyme produced by the SAD1 gene that creates a special double bond critical in determining the melting point of chocolate that is\u00a0very close to the human body temperature and makes cocoa butter quite unique.\u2019 'The \"snap\" and \"melt\" of chocolate are very important textural features that determine the appeal of chocolate to consumers (stock image), and having new varieties of the cocoa plant that produce butter with different melting points would be a valuable resource to control those characteristics,\u2019 Prof Guiltinan said .",

Officials said documents suggest methyl bromide may have been improperly applied in various locations in Puerto Rico. EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said the agency and Puerto Rico's Department of Agriculture are investigating where and when the pesticide was used and how much was applied. Steve Esmond (left) and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine (right), and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at a resort on the island of St. John. The toxic pesticide that poisoned the family has been found in various locations in Puerto Rico,\u00a0the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday . 'The EPA is taking this very seriously,' she said in a phone interview. 'I can't tell you how widespread this is... We're very early in our investigation.' Sean, 16, (pictured) and his 14-year-old brother Ryan remain in comas two weeks after being hospitalized due to being poisoned by methyl bromide . Enck said she is not aware of anyone sickened by methyl bromide in Puerto Rico. The EPA banned the chemical for residential use in 1984, primarily for health concerns. Nancy Feliciano, agriculture department spokeswoman, said Puerto Rico officials would comment soon. The chemical sickened a family of four from Wilmington, Delaware, last month in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two teenage boys went into comas after being exposed at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort in Cruz Bay, St. John. The Esmond family was staying in the second floor of a unit whose first floor was sprayed with the pesticide to eradicate an indoor beetle that eats wood, officials have said. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay. They began having seizures and were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma. Sean, 16, and Ryan, 14, were in critical condition. Family attorney and spokesman James Maron did not respond to messages for comment. He said in a statement last week that the boys remained in critical condition while their mother had been discharged and their father was recuperating. EPA regional administrator Judith Enck said the agency and Puerto Rico's (pictured) Department of Agriculture are investigating where and when the pesticide was used and how much was applied . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released information on the illegal use of methyl bromide after conducting a federal investigation . The EPA has said a certified applicator working for Tennessee-based Terminix used the pesticide at the Virgin Islands resort. Sea Glass Vacations LLC, which rents units at Sirenusa, terminated its contract with Terminix last week. Terminix has said it is conducting its own investigation and is cooperating with the EPA. The U.S. Justice Department also is investigating. EPA officials said Thursday the pesticide used in the Virgin Islands came from licensed distributors in Puerto Rico, where inspectors are visiting pesticide applicator companies, including Terminix. 'This has been prohibited since the 1980s,' Enck said. 'There should be no confusion.' Methyl Bromide, which is odorless, can be fatal or cause serious damage to the central nervous system and respiratory system, according to the EPA. It is acutely toxic, and only permitted to be used outdoors by certified professionals in the US. The family was staying at the $875-a-night Sirenusa Condominium Resort on St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands when they fell ill .

Nick Clegg made a desperate bid to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith yesterday by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician'. He claimed the obese sexual predator did not belong to the Liberal Democrats at the time he was abusing scores of young boys. In fact Smith took the party whip for four years in Parliament and was feted as a Lib Dem grandee in the years before he died. Mr Clegg was accused on a radio phone-in of having 'washed his hands' of the issue by refusing to order a party investigation into Smith. He insisted there would be no inquiry despite revelations in Saturday's Daily Mail that the Liberal party \u2013 a forerunner to the Lib Dems \u2013 offered hush money equivalent to a month's wages to an activist after she complained about Smith molesting a teenage boy in 1979. Mr Clegg was confronted over the Smith scandal during a phone-in show on LBC radio yesterday. He was asked by 'John from Bexleyheath' why the Lib Dems had not investigated despite new details of Smith's prolific paedophilia exposed in this paper's serialisation of Labour politician Simon Danczuk's book about the late Rochdale MP. Mr Clegg attempted to distance the Lib Dems from Smith and said 'any political party' should co-operate with the police inquiry. He said: 'As it happens, Cyril Smith, as you may know, the allegations surrounding him, actually go right back to the time when he was a Labour politician, back, well before I was even born, I think.' Mr Clegg accused Mr Danczuk of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. He added: 'Cyril Smith was active in politics, by the way, in a party which no longer exists \u2013 the Liberal party. 'So he was a Labour politician, and then he was a politician for most of his career, for a Liberal party, which no longer exists. All this happened well before the Liberal Democrats were even formed.' Mr Clegg said the only way to get justice was for the police to investigate and blamed them for not having done so. Mr Danczuk, the Labour candidate for Rochdale, said his book made it clear that Smith had started out as a member of the Labour party. Nick Clegg made a desperate attempt to distance his party from allegations about Cyril Smith today by calling the paedophile MP a 'Labour politician' He added: 'Nobody will be surprised to hear that Nick Clegg is being disingenuous in his comments. Mr Clegg accused Labour's Simon Danczuk (pictured) of choosing 'to airbrush out the fact that actually Cyril Smith was a Labour politician when he was alleged to have started abusing young children'. 'I urge him to face up to the fact that one of his colleagues \u2013 somebody who he and other members of his party celebrated for very many years \u2013 was a paedophile. 'I think it is a disgrace to try to avoid tackling this issue and to try to politicise this issue in the way that he is doing.' Smith was elected as a Liberal MP in 1972, but after the Lib Dems were formed in 1988 took the whip of the new party until his retirement from Parliament in 1992. He remained a Liberal Democrat grandee up to his death in 2010 at the age of 82. A gushing video tribute from Mr Clegg was played at Smith's 80th birthday party at Rochdale town hall in 2008. The Lib Dem leader told him: 'I'm a great admirer of you personally, but also owe you a great debt of gratitude politically too.' The Daily Mail's serialisation of Mr Danczuk's book, Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith, revealed that senior Liberals were made aware of the paedophile MP's abuse. Lord Steel, who as David Steel was Liberal leader from 1976 until 1988 and nominated Smith for a knighthood, was alerted in 1979 to claims that Smith had subjected boys to humiliating spankings but Smith denied any wrongdoing. Senior Lib Dems including the Business Secretary Vince Cable and the former leader Charles Kennedy have insisted they heard nothing. The party has been accused of 'squirming' over the issue.",

Attorneys for the family said in a statement Wednesday night that the wrongful death lawsuit would be filed Thursday. The lawsuit had been expected. Attorneys for Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., announced at a press conference in early March that a wrongful death lawsuit would be filed 'soon.' Scroll down for video . Plans:\u00a0Lawyers for the parents of Michael Brown announced Wednesday night that they planned to file a civil lawsuit the following day against the city of Ferguson . Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in a St. Louis suburb in August 2014. Wilson resigned in November . Attorneys said at the time that the lawsuit would also name former Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. The statement Wednesday did not mention Brown, and a spokesman for the law firm said he could not provide any additional information about the lawsuit. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national 'Black Lives Matter' movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November. But the Justice Department last month released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails. Attorneys for Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and his father, Michael Brown Sr., announced at a press conference in early March that a wrongful death lawsuit would be filed 'soon' Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national 'Black Lives Matter' movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities .",

    "source": "(CNN)We did it again, in another American city. We set Baltimore on fire this time. We brutalized black bodies. We turned a funeral into a riot. We let things get out of hand. We looted. We threw stones at policemen. We threw stones at citizens. We created camera-ready chaos, and we replayed the images. We created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response. We let the violence flow. We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like. By now you may be asking, \"Who's we?\" You may be saying with some irritation, \"Don't lump me in with them. I didn't have anything to do with it.\" To which the only real answer can be: Stop kidding yourself. The word \"we\" is one of the great American words. We the People. Yes we can. We are family. I use \"we\" a lot when I talk about our country's achievements. I like to say we won the Second World War, we put a man on the moon, we invented the Internet, we gave the world jazz. Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too. \"We\" cuts both ways. We enslaved Africans. We cut Reconstruction short and made a mockery of equal citizenship. We supported Jim Crow, then redlined, subordinated, and ghettoized African-Americans. We cut blacks out of the New Deal. We created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly. We tried to put a lid on it with heavy policing and a War on Drugs. We failed. We are the authors of every page of Baltimore's story. Don't tell me it's not your responsibility or mine. About how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past. Someone else's problem. No, we own them all. And we all have to face that before we can fix anything in Baltimore or beyond. But there's another dimension of the story of \"we\" that matters as well. It's about progressives and conservatives and their competing stories of how we got here. Every time protests and violence break out in response to police brutality, the same depressing pattern breaks out. The event becomes simply a Rorschach test for left and right, and each side sees in the rioting confirmation of its prior views. For the left, it's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence. Liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame, like the surprisingly astute comments from the Baltimore Orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable. Conservatives gravitate to their own frames, about a lack of personal responsibility or role models among poor urban blacks, about the failures of Great Society and Democratic programs, and about how it all comes back to a president (who happens to be black) who has divided us by focusing so much on race. What gets lost in this Groundhog Day replay of left-right frames is a simple reality that we all have to recognize: Both longstanding structural racism and personal irresponsibility are on display this week. Both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence. Both an inherited, multigenerational lack of opportunity and a dearth of leaders willing to address it. We cannot separate out the aspects of the problem that don't fit our preferred explanation -- not if we are sincere about solving the problem. And until more people can see this, we will not see progress. We can't judge looters for their antisocial behavior without judging a color-caste structure and a school-to-prison pipeline that has flushed them away like so much refuse. By the same token, we can't keep opining about root causes without also supporting the parents and pastors and neighbors who, in their own small ways, are organizing each other to break the cycle of brokenness. I'm of the left. But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore. It cannot possibly be that only my worldview contains all the solutions. Whatever our political perspective, we need to open our eyes to what is actually happening in Baltimore and other cities in the United States in the second decade of the 21st century. It is an abomination. We should all be able to say that. It's time to push each other out of our ideological and identity comfort zones and build unlikely coalitions to create more opportunity. It's time to act like we are all in charge. Because we are. And there is no other \"we\" waiting in the wings.",

The Brazilian has been at Anfield for eight years and holds the unwanted record of playing more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years. He missed the 2012 League Cup final and two other Wembley appearances that year with a serious knee injury sustained against Chelsea the previous November. His story might not have the celebrity appeal of Gerrard saying goodbye in an FA Cup final on his 35th birthday, but the desire to win the Cup is just as strong. Lucas has been the longest-serving player at Liverpool behind captain Steven Gerrard (right) Lucas has played more games for Liverpool without winning a major trophy than anyone else in 50 years . \u2018I\u2019ve played at the Maracana a few times but never at Wembley,\u2019 said Lucas, 28. \u2018I have been dreaming about it, to be honest. I\u2019ve been at Liverpool so long. Gerrard deserves to win the FA Cup after what he has done for this club. He has won many trophies here but a lot of people here have been working for many years and not won as much as him. We want to win like him.\u2019 When Lucas was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007, Liverpool had just been in their second Champions League final in three seasons. But he has had to endure turbulent times since then; four managers and a change of ownership that dragged Liverpool into virtual civil war. Not surprisingly, the cup finals and trophies dried up. \u2018I didn\u2019t think I was going to stay this long. I felt after the first season I was gone,\u2019 said Lucas with a laugh, having been pilloried by the Kop during his early days. \u2018There have been big changes in the club during my time here and at some point you pay a price for that. Sunday will mark Steven Gerrard\u2019s 36th, and possibly last, appearance at Wembley. Thirty-two of his games have been there for England (including one at the old Wembley) and three for Liverpool. Wembley record for England P32 W24 D4 L4 Goals 8 . Wembley record for Liverpool P3 W1 D1 L1 Goals 0 . Three Wembley highlights . England 2-0 Ukraine - 2000 . Makes his England debut at the old Wembley the day after his 20th birthday and impresses enough to earn a place in Kevin Keegan\u2019s Euro 2000 squad. Plays for 81 minutes before replaced by Kieron Dyer. England 2-0 USA - 2008 . Scores his first goal at the new national stadium when he sidefoots Gareth Barry\u2019s pass past American goalkeeper Brad Guzan. Liverpool 2-1 Everton- 2012 . Having lifted the League Cup earlier in the season, Gerrard returned to Wembley for a sweet FA Cup semi-final victory against their Merseyside rivals, with Andy Carroll heading a late winner. \u2018There was discussion about ownership, the court and all that. It didn\u2019t help. We saw a lot of senior players leaving. This is a chance for our new team to win their first trophy.\u2019 Lucas has gone from an impressionable youngster learning from Gerrard, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso to one of the senior voices in the dressing room. He has seen youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe criticised for being photographed with a shisha pipe and said: \u2018It is hard to give advice because there are so many people always around players. I just think young players shouldn\u2019t get carried away. I had real role models in the dressing room like Pepe and Stevie. You saw they had success because of the way they do things, not just their talent. \u2018Ten years ago, players would have more space. Today we go to a restaurant and everyone is filming, recording or taking pictures. You need to have extra care. If you are having a glass of wine, then people say you are drunk.\u2019 Lucas tries to win a tackle during Liverpool's 2-0 victory at home to Newcastle on Monday night . Lucas celebrates Joe Allen's (right) second goal for Liverpool against Newcastle . Lucas is desperate to win the FA Cup and end his 270-game barren spell at Anfield. The last player to have played more times for Liverpool without winning a major trophy was Alan O\u2019Court who played for the club 345 times between 1952 and 1964, collecting just a Second Division championship medal. Liverpool felt so sorry for Lucas, who was injured for the 2012 League Cup final win, they asked the Football League to send him a medal in the post. Liverpool\u2019s improvements under Rodgers have not so far translated into silverware. They finished second to Manchester City in a thrilling Premier League title race last season and were beaten by eventual winners Chelsea in this year\u2019s Capital One Cup semi-finals. Brendan Rodgers knows, with a far stronger squad than he inherited in 2012, they now have to take the cup competitions seriously. \u2018For me, the objective in the first couple of years was getting into the Champions League,\u2019 he said. \u2018If you look at how we did in the cups we weren\u2019t so good. I felt we didn\u2019t have the squad to challenge. This year we\u2019d arrived into the Champions League and could focus on winning a trophy. We have got to one semi-final already in the Capital One Cup and now we\u2019ve got another chance. Our vision is to win trophies.\u2019 Gerrard has returned to the squad after a three-match ban from being sent off against Manchester United . Gerrard (right) made his Wembley debut for England in 2000 in a friendly against Ukraine . The return of Gerrard into the squad after a three-match ban for stamping on Manchester United\u2019s Ander Herrera is vital to calm any nerves. In contrast to Lucas and others in the Liverpool team, he has played at Wembley 35 times in his career \u2014 and been on the winning side in 25 of them. Rodgers smiles that he will be \u2018heartless\u2019 in deciding whether to name his captain in the starting XI but is adamant Gerrard will make a big contribution. \u2018I\u2019ve had a meal with him, talking over things,\u2019 said the manager. \u2018I am disappointed I didn\u2019t have the chance to work with him for longer. At 24, I would have built a team around him like I did with Luis Suarez. \u2018Wembley is like his second home. He knows what it takes to win there. He\u2019s calm anyway before the games and that is important for us as a team. Everyone respects that I want to do what is best for the team. Status and star quality have never bothered me, really.\u2019",

    "source": "(CNN)By now, you probably have a position regarding the controversy over Indiana's religious freedom law. You applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, using religion as a cover. Or, like Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states. The issue drives a wedge because, well, the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated, but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned. Whichever side you're on, here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy. These points might not change your mind, but offer context to better understand the uproar. As the author of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Sen. Chuck Schumer is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding Indiana's version of the law. Schumer mocks Indiana's contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22-year-old federal law. \"That may be true only if you're using a Funhouse mirror,\" Schumer wrote on his Facebook page. The federal law was intended to protect individual's religious freedom from government intervention, he said. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. Also, the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals, while the Indiana law also protects private companies, Schumer said. So, how can the law's supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law? If you look at the purpose of the law, the language in the federal and Indiana religious freedom laws are indeed  nearly indistinguishable. In short --  the government cannot interfere with a person's religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so. The uproar is over that fact that the Indiana law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved. Other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- Indiana became the 20th. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense. This is how it could make a difference: . In 2006, Vanessa Willock contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner. This was in New Mexico, a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute. The company, Elane Photography, refused the job because of the co-owner's religious beliefs. Willock sued Elane Photography for discrimination, and the company defended itself by citing the law. The photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity. What would happen if that case happened today in Indiana, with the new, expanded religious freedom law? For sure, the case would have proceeded to trial, said Tim Holbrook, a law professor at Emory University. The photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons. Would the outcome have been the same? Would an Indiana jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation? In a letter expressing concern about the Indiana law, a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what Indiana has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns. \"In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests,\" the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. These concerns are based on speculation of what might happen, said Josh Blackman, a constitutional law professor at South Texas College of Law. Yes, the Indiana law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense, he said. \"But, just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful.\" Those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose, Blackman said. In his opinion, if Elane Photography had been able to use the law as a defense in New Mexico, it still likely would have lost the case. What's clear is that Indiana's law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom. The success of such arguments is to be seen. In the meantime, some are already hatching plans on how to test the law, including Bill Levin, founder of The First Church Of Cannabis, who argued on CNN that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. Much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by President Bill Clinton more than 20  years ago. There was bipartisan support in 1993, so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015, some ask? Context, timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed. The federal law was written by two Democrats, Schumer and the late Sen. Edward Kennedy. Today, it is being championed by Republicans. The law came into being after two Native Americans in Oregon were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote, the hallucinogenic cactus. They were denied unemployment benefits, and they sued the state, claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs. They lost the case. There was outrage over the decision, and the law was created as a remedy. As envisioned by its authors, it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities. Over the years, the law helped a number of people -- a Muslim prisoner won the right to grow a short beard, a Santeria priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions, and a Native American boy received an exception to his school's policy banning long hair on boys. The law was on the books for years, with little attention paid to it. But Holbrook says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps. Many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow Christians to deny services to same-sex couples. Holbrook said. \"The timing is beyond a coincidence,\" he said. \"We are having an interest in RFRA at the time same-sex marriage is coming forward.\" Though not enshrined in the law, critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion. Blackman said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination. The expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it, but most will likely lose, he said. \"The moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the RFRA,\" he said. So we've established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the Indiana law is the scope: In Indiana, the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes, while the federal law applies only to government matters. Not so fast. According to Blackman, the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform. Four U.S. circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties. Two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed. And then, there is the Hobby Lobby case. Hobby Lobby, citing the federal religious freedom law, argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via Obamacare because it was against the owners' beliefs. And, Hobby Lobby won the case before the Supreme Court. The ruling, in effect, expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business. The Hobby Lobby decision, plus the appeals courts rulings, may have opened the door for states like Indiana to be explicit about its expansion of the law. One way to look at it, Blackman said, is that Indiana simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts. The outrage over the Indiana law is that it can be used to deny services to the LGBT community on the ground of religious beliefs. Some may rightfully ask, \"Where was the outrage before the religious freedom law?\" Indiana does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In that sense, the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Even before the controversial Indiana law was passed, if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple, the couple might be able to sue, but not for discrimination. For that matter, there is also no federal law that protects the LGBT community. According to the Human Rights Campaign, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired, denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace. And their recourse is limited. With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. Another hypothetical outcome of the New Mexico case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio. If New Mexico had the same religious freedom law as Indiana, the case would have gone to trial. But New Mexico has a nondiscrimination law that protects the LGBT community, it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim. In Indiana, that protection would be lacking. (It gets more complicated when some local governments, like the city of Indianapolis, do have nondiscrimination ordinances). For this reason, Holbrook suggests that a \"fix\" for the Indiana law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law. Or, at the very least, an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination.",

    "source": "Lord Stevens is to be investigated over hotly disputed allegations of a cover-up of police corruption in the bungled Step-hen Lawrence murder probe. Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it will investigate claims that the former Met chief failed to hand over key information to the Macpherson Inquiry regarding the black teenager\u2019s race hate killing. The watchdog probe stems from a complaint from Stephen\u2019s father Neville Lawrence. Lord Stevens was deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1998 to 2000 \u2013 while the Macpherson Inquiry report was being compiled \u2013 before serving five years as the UK\u2019s most senior policeman. 'Cover-up':\u00a0Former Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens (left) is to be investigated into allegations of a cover-up over the Stephen Lawrence murder probe in the nineties . Sparked new investigation: Neville Lawrence, the father of murdered Stephen Lawrence, made a complaint last October about the failure of senior officers during the Macpherson Inquiry . The complaint concerns a letter to the Macpherson Inquiry in 1998, in which Lord Stevens stated that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption. It is alleged that the letter included misleading information. However, last night sources close to the former Scotland Yard commissioner said he was vindicated last year by Mark Ellison QC, the author of an official report into the Lawrence corruption allegations. A source said: \u2018Any suggestion that anyone from the Met would seek to withhold the truth from the Macpherson Inquiry at that time is completely untrue. Last year Mark Ellison wrote to Lord Stevens to say he had done nothing wrong.\u2019 Last night, Channel 4 News \u2013 which revealed details of the IPCC probe into Lord Stevens \u2013 quoted him as saying: \u2018Step very carefully, I\u2019m not putting up with any more c**p about this.\u2019 Quoting from a letter he received from Mr Ellison, Lord Stevens was reported to have said: \u2018No one is suggesting that you did anything that was culpable in any way.\u2019 Baroness Lawrence, pictured taking her seat in the House of Lords in 2013, described undercover police officers as 'disgraceful' following the findings of the Ellison review last year . The IPCC said: \u2018We can confirm we are independently investigating Lord Stevens following a referral from the Metropolitan Police.\u2019 The Met said that after it received \u2018a public complaint in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019 it made a referral to the IPCC last November. The Met\u2019s statement added: \u2018The complaint has been made in relation to Lord Stevens\u2019s role as the then deputy commissioner and disclosure to the Macpherson Inquiry. Facing probe: Lord Stevens pictured in 2001 alongside Neville Lawrence, whose complaint has sparked the latest investigation . \u2018This issue was raised in the Stephen Lawrence Independent Review by Mark Ellison QC, where he concluded there were defects in the level of information that the Metropolitan Police revealed to the inquiry.\u2019 Mr Lawrence had asked the IPCC to look into alleged failures of senior officers, including Lord Stevens, to provide \u2018full, frank and truthful\u2019 information to the inquiry as well as claims that hundreds of files on past major police corruption probes were shredded. He welcomed the IPCC\u2019s decision to investigate, telling Channel 4 News: \u2018I\u2019m hoping that this time they\u2019re going to come back with a result that can help us to get further into the truth of what was happening during the investigation into Stephen\u2019s death.\u2019 It took more than 18 years to bring two of Stephen\u2019s killers \u2013 Gary Dobson and David Norris \u2013 to justice and they were jailed for life in 2012. Also that year, Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned Mr Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation, and whether evidence had been withheld from the Macpherson Inquiry. Last year she told Parliament that there were \u2018serious concerns that\u2026 relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed\u2019. When the Ellison review reported last year it said one former detective, John Davidson, was suspected of corruption in the Lawrence case, in which he had a key role. Mr Davidson has always denied the claims. Long battle for justice: Stephen's mother Doreen, now Baroness Lawrence, and father Neville have been campaigning for more than 20 years . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge meet with Baroness Lawrence, Stephen's mother, at\u00a0the Stephen Lawrence Centre last month . Damning: In his 1999 report William Macpherson accused\u00a0the Met Police of being institutionally racist . In 1998, five years after Stephen Lawrence was murdered in south east London, retired High Court judge Sir William Macpherson was appointed to head an inquiry into the killing. Macpherson led the review into the conduct of the Metropolitan Police during the murder investigation after the police's initial failure to apprehend the black teenager's killers. In his report, published in February 1999, Macpherson accused the Met of being institutionally racist but concluded that police corruption had not thwarted the case. However, he widely criticised the force's handling of the Lawrence case and said police did not carry out the investigation in an appropriate manner. He made over 70 recommendations, including to extend the number of offences classified as racist, make the police subject to greater public control and protect the rights for victims of crime. He also recommended that police forces increase the number of black and Asian officers, prompting the Government to pledge to increase the number of officers from minority ethnic groups from 2,500 to 8,000 by 2009. And he recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence \u2013 something which became the law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The Macpherson Report was dubbed 'one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain' and credited with improving police attitudes to racism. Jack Straw, who was the Home Secretary from 1997 to 2001 during the time of the report, has previously declared that ordering the inquiry was 'the single most important decision I made as Home Secretary'. However, Home Secretary Theresa May expressed concerns in 2012 that evidence may have been withheld from the 1999 inquiry. She commissioned Mark Ellison QC to lead an independent review into whether there was evidence of corruption in the original Lawrence investigation and last year told Parliament that there were 'serious concerns that\u2026relevant material which would show corruption has not been revealed because it cannot be found or has been destroyed.' Lord Stevens is now accused of failing to hand information over to the Macpherson public inquiry. He originally stated in 1998 that no officer or former officer involved in giving evidence was under investigation for corruption.",

The contraceptive is made with hydrogel, a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue. The groundbreaking design will eventually offer functions like self-lubrication, topical drug delivery, and even electric conductivity, dramatically changing the capacity of male contraception, reports\u00a0Science Alert. Scientists from the University of Wollongong are designing ultra-durable condoms they claim could feel even better than nothing at all . The contraceptive is made with hydrogel, a strong and flexible solid which can be made to feel and act like human tissue . The Australian team behind the design, led by materials scientist Robert Gorkin, won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013, giving them access to US$100,000 to use on research. 'Our original idea was just to try to prove that an original material could replace latex,' Mr Gorkin said. 'We were starting from scratch, we had an idea that these new materials would have the same properties as rubber with a nicer feel, but we weren't sure if they had the right properties for a condom.' 'The early indications are that the materials are strong enough and actually do prevent against the transfer of small biological molecules,' he said. Robert Gorkin, the leader of the research team responsible for the design, said: 'If you make them so pleasurable that people can't wait to put them on, then more people will use them' The team won a grant for a next generation condom in 2013, giving them access to US$100,000 to use on research . Hydrogel has been around for decades, but it has risen to prominence in recent years, after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels. The researchers now plan to partner with Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material. 'We'll be able to look at brain activity to see whether it really feels better than latex,' said Gorkin. 'If you make them so pleasurable that people can't wait to put them on, then more people will use them, and we can hopefully stop the spread of disease. It's as simple as that.' Hydrogel (pictured) has been around for decades, but it has risen to prominence in recent years, after being used in prosthetics for the likes of eye implants and blood vessels . The researchers plan to conduct biometric testing to measure the bodies response to the material . Gorkin is hoping to design the product to accommodate for the around the cultural and social needs for birth control. 'It's a branding exercise as much as a scientific one,' said Gorkin. 'A material alone can't change the way we look at sex, but we believe it can definitely help.'",

    "source": "When Floyd Mayweather posted a picture of a signed contract for his $300 million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao two months ago, there was a collective sigh of relief. After more than five years of wrangling and bickering, the richest fight in boxing history was finally set for May 2 in Las Vegas. But with 11 days to go until the two protagonists are due to touch gloves, not a single person has a ticket in their hands. Floyd Mayweather fights Manny Pacquiao next weekend but officially, no tickets are on sale . That's not to say that nobody has bought one; SeatGeek, which claims to be the world's largest event ticket search engine, is selling briefs for up to $30,000 (\u00a320,000). These are known as 'spec tickets' which the sellers don't have but expect to get before the fight. The venue for the bout, the 16,500-capacity MGM Grand Arena has the following message on its website: . 'Details on ticket sales coming soon! Please be aware that tickets for the May 2, 2015, Mayweather vs Pacquiao fight are not yet available for purchase. 'Buyers should use extra caution when purchasing alleged tickets from unofficial sources, for fraudulent or counterfeit tickets will not be accepted.' So why the delay? Initially, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum said tickets would be on sale in the first week of April but that less than 1,000 - priced between $1,500 and $7,500 - were expected to be made available to the public. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum (left) has blamed Mayweather's side for the lack of tickets . Leonard Ellerbe, CEO of Mayweather Promotions, claimed they would be on sale last week . The rest would be distributed by the fighters, promoters, television networks Showtime and HBO and the MGM Grand. But last week, SeatGeek analyst Connor Gregoire said: 'It's bizarre, normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight.\u00a0To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Gregoire went on to say that only a dozen tickets had been sold through the website at an average price of $8,000 (\u00a35,400). Another ticketing site, StubHub, are yet to put any tickets on sale. Spokesperson Alison Salcedo said: 'There's still so much up in the air for this fight that we're not allowing spec sales. We're not willing to take that risk now.' As far as Arum is concerned, the blame lies squarely on Mayweather's side. 'All of this is on the MGM (Grand), I mean, if you think that the MGM is calling the shots here, you're totally mistaken. It's the man behind the curtain,' he told Boxing Scene, alluding to Mayweather's adviser Al Haymon. Mayweather trains with his uncle Roger during a media workout in Las Vegas last week . Pacquiao is taken on the pads by trainer Freddie Roach in front of the watching media . 'This is going to the governor's office. This is an absolute disgrace, what's happening. 'What do you want from me? It's not on us.' Pacquiao's manager Michael Koncz has also expressed his frustration. He said: 'It's a real mess right now. I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the holdup? I'm more than a little upset they're not for sale to the public.' In the opposite corner, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe has claimed Arum was lashing out because he is not the lead promoter in the fight. 'Every time he doesn't get his way, he goes running to the press misrepresenting the facts,' he said. 'The bottom line is this: Bob cannot stomach the fact that he is not the lead promoter. Reality has set in, and this is typical Bob. My responsibility is to ensure every deal is done properly, to benefit the fighters and the event.' It remains to be seen who will make up the 16,500-capacity crowd at the MGM Grand . Ellerbe did say that tickets would be on sale last week but there is no sign of an end to the stalemate. Nor is there any indication of when the reported 50,000 closed-circuit seats at MGM properties - priced at around $150 (\u00a3100) - in Las Vegas will be available to purchase. The hotel's website says simply: 'Please check back for closed-circuit viewing availability at other MGM Resorts Properties.' In fact, the only ticket you can buy is for the weigh-in. Priced at $10, the unusual step has been taken in an effort to control the expected huge crowd but all proceeds will go to charity with each fighter nominating their choice. With UFC star Ronda Rousey guaranteed the only free ticket from Arum and Amir Khan set to be ringside next Saturday as he eyes a future fight against either man, there will at least be a crowd of sorts. But who will join them is anyone's guess.",

Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel conjured one of the biggest surprises for many a Formula One season with the team's first victory for almost two years at the last race in Malaysia. Many people expected another dominant Mercedes campaign in the wake of last season's crushing success and thoroughly convincing win in the opening race in Australia. Lewis Hamilton was fastest in first practice for this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix . The Mercedes driver, who leads the championship, set the pace as he bids to win his fourth race in China . Hamilton was over half-a-second clear of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in opening practice . 1. Lewis Hamilton  Mercedes 1:39.033 . 2. Nico Rosberg  Mercedes 1:39.574 . 3.

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes responded in the first practice session ahead of the latest race at the Shanghai International Circuit, and none more so than reigning champion Hamilton. A three-times winner at this track, including last season, Hamilton finished 0.541secs clear of team-mate Nico Rosberg, with a best lap of one minute 39.033secs. None of their rivals even came close, with Vettel a further half a second adrift at 1:40.157secs, with his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen 1.6secs down on Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas was ninth in his Williams, over two seconds shy of Hamilton's best time . Jenson Button was within three seconds of Hamilton's lap and 13th in the first practice standings . Fresh from winning in Malaysia, Vettel was best of the rest in Shanghai behind the two Mercedes drivers . To underline Mercedes' supremacy and the gap to Raikkonen, from the Finn in fourth to Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in 18th, there was a difference of just 1.5secs. Behind Mercedes and Ferrari, the best of the rest was Felipe Nasr in his Sauber, with the Brazilian rookie 1.979secs off the pace, whilst Daniel Ricciardo finished 1.996secs down for Red Bull. No other driver came within two seconds of Hamilton, with Daniil Kvyat seventh for Red Bull, followed by Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz. The Williams duo of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa completed the top 10, 2.27secs adrift and split by a mere one thousandth of a second. As for McLaren, Jenson Button was 13th and Fernando Alonso 17th, with the latter 3.128secs behind Hamilton, with even Jolyon Palmer ahead of him on his debut for Lotus. Last year's GP2 champion, serving as reserve with Lotus this season, was 15th and 2.934secs down, with highly-experienced team-mate Pastor Maldonado only 0.6secs ahead. Manor pair Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi both enjoyed plenty of track time, completing 38 laps between them. For young British rookie Stevens his 18 laps were crucial as he had so far failed to take part in either qualifying session or race in Australia and Malaysia. Stevens finished 6.346secs behind Hamilton, with Merhi bringing up the rear another 1.1secs down.",

    "source": "An explosive new report reveals that the United States began secretly tracking phones long before the events of 9/11 or passage of the Patriot Act. In 1992, a Drug Enforcement Agency operation which has since been discontinued, monitored every telephone call made from the United States to one of the up to 116 countries on their watch list for drug trafficking, including almost every country in both North and South America. USA Today uncovered the details of the program, whose vastness was not known until now, and whose practices, especially in gathering bulk information, later became a model for the National Security Agency. Scroll down for video . It has been revealed the government began secretly tracking phone calls under a program created for the Drug Enforcement Agency in 1992 . The DEA program and its aims had been revealed earlier this year in a report from the Justice Department, though there was no mention of just how big the program was, and the amount of data the agency was authorized to gather. This is also now the oldest known example of the American government authorizing this level of tracking on unknowing citizens of the country. The goal was to infiltrate drug trafficking rings, especially those that were previously unknown to members of the DEA and federal government. The program also allowed agents to monitor calls the ruled out the possibility of foreign ties to the 1995 bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building by American Timothy McVeigh. The program only recently shuttered, and was used for nearly two decades, with top Justice Department officials in four administrations - George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama - approving the data collections. The data collection did not however allow DEA investigators access to the actual content of calls, just the numbers dialed and time of the calls were all recorded. A 1998 request for Sprint to release their call records to the program labeled it as 'one of the most important and effective Federal drug law enforcement initiatives.' The program was eventually halted not because it had run its course, but rather out of fear for public response should the details be revealed. That decision came from Attorney General Eric Holder in September 2013, just months after Edward Snowden began systematically releasing classified information he obtained while working at the NSA, most notably documents that detailed the agency's reach, which while viewed by some as crucial and necessary, was seen by many as an Orwellian nightmare, specifically as it pertained to the freedoms and allowances the agency had been granted when it came to spying on Americans. The DEA confirmed this, and they now send subpoenas on a daily basis to telephone companies to obtain records. Former officials who worked at the agency prior to and during the program's inception speak of it as a necessity at the time as they attempted to combat the seemingly untouchable and infallible Colombian drug cartels. In that regard the program was a massive success, allowing agency officials to take down larger members of drug organizations thanks to a system that no longer required them to reach out to the phone companies every day, where the could only request individual phone records. And this years before the program had begun, and the agency was working with just the principles they had developed, two supercomputers and a team of analysts. Officials could not reveal those the program helped the agency to capture, but we do know that Colombian barons Carlos Lehder, Griselda Blanco and Daniel Barrera Barrera, also known as El Loco, were all captured by or with the help of the DEA in the years prior to the program. The success of this new system impressed President George H.W. Bush, who spoke of the idea of 'sophisticated intelligence-gathering and Defense Department technology' in a 1989 speech, the first time these concepts had been mentioned by a president. Those successes were short lived however, and just three years later drug crimes were hitting record highs while also turning increasingly violent, especially in Miami. It was around this time that the DEA program was approved, with President George H.W. Bush, along with Attorney General William Barr and chief criminal prosecutor, Robert Mueller, giving the agency these new data collection privileges in the final months of his first term. The report did not reveal when exactly this happened, and if he granted this before or after his failed bid for reelection. The DEA, who just years earlier were reaching out to phone companies in search of individual records, would now receive phone company records on a daily basis thanks to a request from the Justice Department. What's more, whereas before the focus was on getting records only of those who were known drug suspects due to time constraints, the agency now received a list of every single phone call from an American phone line to a country on the drug watch list. The countries changed, with some coming on then going off then coming on again, but the data as always the number and time of the call. There was push back from some of the telephone companies at the time, but never to the point that any of them challenged the subpoenas in court. They may have also seen no point in challenging these subpoenas in a court when those companies that did show hesitation received a letter from the Justice Department 'urging them to comply.' The aforementioned letter to Sprint in 1998 was an example of these notes sent to the phone companies, and given the fact that six years later there was still unease about turning over these records it would seem this was a constant battle throughout the years the program was active. That same letter provides another look at why going to court may have seemed pointless, as the Justice Department wrote that the program was 'legally appropriate' in the note, penned by then deputy assistant attorney general Mary Lee Warren. The scope of what the records could be used for was heavily checked prior to 9/11, with all the data being used to investigate drug investigations, with the exception of a few incidents that were seen as potential threats to national security, like Oklahoma City. With the program now shuttered, there are some concerns about the list of countries on the DEA list being revealed, though officials said that in many cases they were aware of the program, which would likely be just as beneficial to them as to the United States. The information was also passed along to foreign governments who in turn used it in building their own cases and investigations.",

CBS reports that the judge told her to stay out of trouble but that she allegedly used an emergency exit door at a Bronx subway station instead of paying for a metro card along with her 19-year-old niece Tracy Barrientos. Scroll down for video . Covered: Alleged 'serial bride' Liana Barrientos accused of running a wife-for-hire immigration covers her face as she leaves court for a second time on Friday with her niece, this time for evading a subway fare . Emergency exit: Barrientos used the emergency exit at this Bronx subway station on Friday instead of paying a fare for her trip just hours after leaving the court . Barrientos was granted the new charge of theft of service, and was released without any bail being set. Her niece\u2019s case was also dismissed. In video of Barrientos leaving the court she can be seen cursing, throwing punches, and spitting at the cameras as she covers her face. This is shortly after she pleaded not guilty to marrying numerous men, some of whom who could pose a threat to American safety, say investigators. One of the men 38-year-old Lianna Barrientos wed was deported back to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States in 2006 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from\u00a0Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to\u00a0The New York Daily News. At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously.

Charged: The Bronx district attorney's office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges . Swindle: Barrientos is accused of accepting money in at least one of the marriages, prosecutors say . All of her marriages took place in New York state, allegedly starting in 1999. Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali,\u00a0- \u00a0the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.' Bride: Liana Barrientos, pictured, has been married ten times. Her first marriage took place in 1999, with most recent being in 2010 . Barrientos' marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril .

According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents,\u00a0The New York Daily News\u00a0said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.' The newspaper reported that Barrientos could be sentenced to a total of eight years stemming from her two charges. Barrientos has been arrested multiple times, including for loitering, drug possession, and jumping a turnstile and trespassing, according to the Daily News. Mystery: The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office told the New York Times . According to the New York Times, '[Barrientos] has divorced at least four times, from husbands Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7, but long after marrying husbands 3 through 9.' The Times reported that for her first three 2002 marriages, Barrientos wed Koridze on Valentine's Day, before she went on to marry Goktepe approximately two weeks later, then soon tied the knot with Paharelau. The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office revealed to the Times. Barrientos' Facebook profile says she hails from the Dominican Republic and lives in Manhattan. It also says she became engaged in July 2013. Wedding bells? Barrientos' Facebook says she became engaged in July 2013 . A Bronx building superintendent, Ruben George, told the New York Post 'She was arrested... and [her baby daddy Carlos Garcia] doesn't want her back. 'They have a kid together. She has one with him and one with somebody else.' George also told the newspaper Garcia booted Barrientos out of his apartment. According to the Post, Barrientos and Garcia are parents to a baby girl. Barrientos did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online.",

    "source": "The parents of Michael Brown have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city of Ferguson over the fatal shooting of their son by a white police officer, a confrontation that sparked a national protest movement. Attorneys for Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., filed the complaint at the St. Louis County Courthouse on Thursday and called a news conference to announce that the case would bring to light new forensic evidence and raise doubts about the police version of events. The lawsuit is seeking $75,000 in compensation, as well as unspecified punitive damages, and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques 'that demean, disregard, or underserve its African-American population'. Scroll down for video . Attorney Anthony Gray speaks as Michael Brown's parents, Lesley McSpadden, second from left, and Michael Brown Sr., right, listen along with attorney Benjamin Crump, left, during Thursday's news conference . The family's lawsuit is seeking $75,000 in compensation, as well as unspecified punitive damages, and calls for a court order prohibiting the use of police techniques 'that demean, disregard, or underserve its African-American population' Brown's parents didn't speak, but Lesley McSpadden wore a red hoodie bearing her son's likeness, while Mike Brown Sr. wore a St. Louis Cardinals snapback and a hoodie that said, 'Mike Brown chosen for change'. The new lawsuit alleges that Officer Darren Wilson destroyed evidence after he shot Brown on the street of the St. Louis suburb last August, saying he washed blood off his hands and cleared and bagged the gun used in the shooting. 'We expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before, that you have never seen,' Anthony Gray, one of the lawyers for Brown's family, said at Thursday's news conference. The civil suit claims Brown had his hands up in surrender when he was killed, a claim strongly disputed during the previous investigation. Gray said evidence had not been presented properly in the previous investigations and he criticized the prosecutor who had presented the case to a grand jury. 'The evidence has not changed, but the presentation of that evidence will,' he said of the civil lawsuit. The civil lawsuit names the city of Ferguson, former Police Chief Thomas Jackson and former police officer Darren Wilson as defendants. 'We expect to put on evidence that you never heard about before, that you have never seen,' said Anthony Gray, left, during Thursday's press conference . Wilson 'unjustifiably shot and killed (Brown), using an unnecessary and unreasonable amount (of) force in violation of (Brown's) constitutionally guaranteed right to life,' the lawsuit states. Jackson, who resigned last month, is included because he 'maintained general supervision' of Wilson and 'was also responsible for his hiring, training and retention,' the lawsuit states. If it comes to trial, the lawsuit could force a full review of all the evidence in the shooting and bring key witnesses to be questioned in open court, including Wilson. Attorney Benjamin Crump told reporters that the alleged subterfuge with which investigators handled the Wilson probe is indicative of a national trend. He cited the cases of Eric Garner, Floyd Dent, Tamir Riceand Antonio Zambrano-Montes. 'The narrative of the law enforcement all across the country for shooting unarmed people of color is the same: That they had no other choice,'  Crump said. 'But time and time again, the objective evidence contradicts the standard police narrative.' The lawsuit also lists incidents of alleged unlawful stops and arrests of African-Americans in Ferguson. It asks for the court to assign a monitor to the city's police force for five years or until 'the city of Ferguson has fully and effectually trained all of its police officers on the constitutional requirements of the use of deadly force.' Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, wore a sweatshirt remembering her son during Thursday's new conference, left, while\u00a0Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, as also in attendance . Brown, 18, was unarmed and walking in the street with a friend on August 9 when Wilson told them to move to the sidewalk. That led to a heated confrontation and a scuffle between Wilson and Brown inside Wilson's squad car. Wilson shot Brown after the scuffle spilled into the street. Some witnesses said Brown was trying to surrender, but Wilson said Brown was moving toward him aggressively, forcing him to shoot. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national Black Lives Matter movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities. In the end, local and federal authorities ruled that the shooting was justified. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November. But the Justice Department released a scathing report citing racial bias and profiling in the Ferguson Police Department and a profit-driven municipal court system that frequently targets black residents. Several city officials resigned following the review, including the city manager, police chief and municipal judge. The municipal court clerk was fired for racist emails. Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in a St. Louis suburb in August 2014. Wilson resigned in November . Civil cases generally require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases. Jurors must find a preponderance of evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt needed to convict in a criminal trial. Two decades ago, football star O.J. Simpson was acquitted of the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. But a civil jury awarded the Brown and Goldman families $33.5 million in wrongful-death damages. The family of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed man killed by police in 1999, settled with New York City for $3 million in 2004 after filing a $60 million lawsuit. The city did not admit any wrongdoing. The settlement came after four officers indicted in his shooting were acquitted of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. Wrongful-death lawsuits have been filed in other recent high-profile cases, too. In New York, the family of Eric Garner is seeking $75 million in damages. Garner, who was black and had asthma, died in July after a white plainclothes officer applied what a medical examiner determined was a chokehold after Garner was accused of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes on a city street. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national 'Black Lives Matter' movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities .",

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85), \u00a0Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used:\u00a0Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut . Goals:\u00a0Tomlin 50, Bamford 66 .

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .",

Her boyfriend has also jumped on the superfood bandwagon and takes bee pollen (the superfood loved by Victoria Beckham that contains almost all of the nutrients we need) to beat his hayfever. Tipper grew up on a farm and quickly became fascinated by the power of plants and Chinese medicine  after her parents, pictured, introduced her to organic produce . Tipper works behind the scenes at the UK's leading superfood supplier, so what big health trends can we look out for this year? 'Goldenberries are the new goji berries,' she said. 'They are amazing for your beauty, rich in antioxidants, protect your body and regulate blood sugar levels. They also help with collagen production so are amazing for keeping wrinkles at bay.' Whilst Tipper has quietly been consuming superfoods her whole life, she thinks celebrities such as Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have 'opened a door for the public' by professing their love of all things clean and lean. 'Celebrities have done so well in raising awareness that things that are good for you can also taste nice. I know this way of life isn't for everyone but I would love to see more people embracing it. 'I would love to see children eating superfoods. Watching them eat sugary cereal bars on the way to school is soul destroying,' she said. Super Feel-Good Golden Berry Cups .

It has been designed to put your colour vision and eyesight to the test by showing boards of coloured squares. On each board, one of the squares is a slightly different shade of the same colour and the aim is to find this odd square by tapping it with your finger or clicking it with the mouse. Click the Start button below to play Kuku Kube . Kuku Kube (pictured) is available for free on Facebook, Android, iOS and on desktop browsers. Scores lower than 11 are poor, scores between 15 and 20 is 'lower than average', 21 to 30 is considered normal or average, and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is considered great' Although the game appears relatively simple, and starts with a board of just four coloured squares, it quickly grows to a board of up to 81 squares. And the differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time. Players get a point for every correct square identified, but if they click or tap the wrong square they lose a point. Plus, players get just 60 seconds to find the odd square on each board before the timer runs out and the game ends. It was created by Canada-based Network365 and is available for free on Facebook, Android, iOS and on desktop browsers. Although the game appears relatively simple, and starts with a board of just four coloured squares (left), it quickly grows (right). The differentiation between the shades becomes more subtle over time . There are eight levels, and as a player progresses the squares change orientation or add borders to make it harder. On the desktop version the game lets you continue until the timer runs out, but on the mobile apps (pictured) players can't progress until they have scored more than 20 on each level .

On the desktop version the game lets you continue until the timer runs out, but on mobile apps players can't progress until they have scored more than 20 points on each level. The app makers said scores lower than 11 are poor, scores between 15 and 20 is 'lower than average', 21 to 30 is considered normal or average, and a score higher than 31 means your eyesight is 'great.' 'This puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision,' said the developers, but isn't intended to replace a full or partial eye examination . 'This puzzle is designed to evaluate the quality of your colour vision,' said the developers. 'You should identify the difference, if possible, and\u00a0share your result with your friends.' But they stressed:\u00a0'Even though this test can be very accurate, it should never be used to replace a doctor's visit. '[It] provides basic information and guideline for your eyesight and colour test, and is not intended to replace a full or partial eye examination.' Eyesight and colour was recently linked to how we perceive the world by Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Facebook-owned virtual reality (VR) experts Oculus. He explained that humans only have three colour sensors, we can\u2019t see infrared or ultraviolet and we have a blind spot in each eye. \u2018Our visual data is actually astonishingly sparse and even if we were able to accurately record and process every photon that reaches our eyes, we\u2019d still have too little data to be able to reconstruct the world accurately,' he said. He used the recent black and blue/white and gold dress as an example. \u2018Our visual system takes its best guess and sends that to the conscious mind,\u2019 he continued. The blue and black (or gold and white) dress that sweeped the internet last month revealed just how differently two people can see the world. But it's not just about lighting conditions or optical illusions - evidence is mounting that until we have a way to describe something, we may not see its there. Ancient languages, for instance, didn't have a word for blue and scientists believe as a result our ancestors didn't notice the colour even existed. In 1858 William Gladstone, who later became the British prime minister, counted the colour references in the Homer's Odyssey and found blue wasn't mentioned at all. Black is mentioned nearly 200 times and white about 100. Red, meanwhile, is mentioned fewer than 15 times, and yellow and green fewer than 10. And blue doesn't appear in Greek texts, the Koran, ancient Chinese stories, and an ancient Hebrew version of the Bible, according to a German philologist named Lazarus Geiger. Egyptians, who were the only culture that could produce blue dyes, were the first ancient civilisation to have a word for the colour blue and there remain tribes today who don't have a word for blue, such as the Himba people in Namibia. Several years ago, researchers showed some of the Himba tribe a circle with 11 green squares and one blue. The study found they could not pick out which one was different from the others, or took much longer to make sense of it. However, the same tribe has many different words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they could pick it out immediately. Researchers showed the Himba tribe in Namibia  11 green squares with one blue. The study found they couldn't pick out which was different from the others, but the same tribe has many words for green. When they were shown squares with one green a different shade, they  picked it out immediately (second top left) 'The way that the brain compensates for the limited data it receives is by maintaining a model of the real world that it constantly updates as new data comes in. 'And it is that model, not the real world, that you experience and trust implicitly. We are inference machines, not objective observers. He then showed a red and blue pill on hands that were shown on a yellow background to give an example of how this inference model breaks down. Michael Abrash, chief scientist from Oculus recently used this image to show how vision is simply our perception of the world, but isn't realty. The pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them . The colours of the pills are the same shade of grey, and the red and blue colours that people see are simply what their brains perceive, based on the rest of the information around them. And even when a person knows that the pills are grey, they still see them as red or blue. \u2018Your visual system isn\u2019t interested in whether the photons coming from a tile on a random image are red or blue or grey,' Mr Abrash continued. 'Knowing that didn\u2019t keep anyone from being eaten by lions on the Savannah. What it is interested in is identifying potentially relevant features, in the real world, under a variety of conditions. 'Your visual system constantly corrects for the colours in the scene. It is reverse engineering reality rather than just recording it. The colours seen are your brain\u2019s \u201cbest guess.\u201d\u2019",

Alfred Guy Vuozzo swore loudly as\u00a0he was told he would not be eligible for parole for 35 years for murdering Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon, 39, on Prince Edward Island last August. As he was escorted from the courtroom, he screamed: 'You've sentenced me to life and I sent them to death', while the judge called the brutal double-murder an act of 'hatred and misdirected vengeance'. Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, later received a nine-month sentence for dangerous driving. Scroll down for video . 'Revenge': Alfred Guy Vuozzo, 46, has been sentenced to life in prison after shooting dead Brent McGuigan, 68, and his son, Brendon (both pictured), 39, because they were related to a driver who killed his nine-year-old sister in a crash 45 years ago. The defendant was told that he will not be eligible for parole for 35 years . Crash: Vuozzo was two years old when his older sister, Cathy, was killed in a crash in 1970. Brent's father, Herbert, who was behind the wheel, received a nine-month sentence. Above, a newspaper photo of the crash . After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home on St Mary's Road, near the town of Montague,\u00a0CTV News reported. He shot them both in 'execution-style' killings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the crash that had claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago. In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. At the time, he told the court that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. He added he had needed to do something for her. 'Call me a cold-blooded killer, but I'm not,' he said. Before his sentencing on Monday, Vuozzo said Herbert's 'short' sentence 'has haunted me all my life', saying: 'That's all her life was worth. She only had nine years in this world. And nobody cared.' Shooting: After more than 40 years of torment, Vuozzo confronted the driver's son, Brent, and grandson, Brendon, in their home near Montague, Prince Edward Island, and shot them. Above, police at the scene . Emergency vehicle: He killed both in 'execution-style' slayings to avenge his sister's death - despite neither victim having had anything to do with the car crash that claimed the life of his sibling all those years ago . However, Crown lawyer John Diamond told the provincial Supreme Court in Charlottetown that Vuozzo was a 'cold-hearted' murderer who had shot his victims with a handgun to get 'revenge'. 'It was revenge. He was a cold-hearted and calculated individual,' he told the court,\u00a0CBC reported. Mr Diamond also called the double-murder on August 20 'callous', 'pointless', and the worst crime in the Island's history, adding that it has caused life-long pain for surviving McGuigan family members. In a victim impact statement, Brent's wife and Brendon's mother, Marie McGuigan, who was home at the time but was not targeted by a hell-bent Vuozzo, said 'a part of me died with them that night'. Attack: In February, Vuozzo pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of Brent and the second-degree murder of Brendon. He said that when Cathy was killed, 'Our lives were ruined'. Above, the scene of the killings . Meanwhile, Brent's only daughter, Donna, said she has been consumed by hatred. 'I feel so much anger and hatred that it scares me. I hate that they died this way and it haunts me,' she sobbed. At an earlier hearing, Gerald Quinn, prosecuting, explained how Cathy had been fatally thrown from a car being driven by her father when it was struck by Mr McGuigan, who was driving a truck, in 1970. The youngster's father and two other children also received minor injuries in the crash, but Herbert was not injured,\u00a0The Eastern Graphic\u00a0reported.\u00a0Cathy died on the scene near Commercial Road. Mr McGuigan has since passed away. Referring to Brent and Brendon, Quinn said: 'These two men, by all accounts, were good hard-working men, had no involvement whatsoever in the motor vehicle accident years ago, at all. He added: 'This gentlemen [Vuozzo] had no familiarity with them other than knowing who they were.\u00a0He walked into the home and he shot them both multiple times and killed them.' Thane MacEachern, defending, argued that the defendant had no previous criminal record and had suffered from depression and mental illness prior to the shootings, according to\u00a0CBC. Vuozzo, of Lower Montague, will be 81 by the time he is\u00a0eligible\u00a0for parole. The first 25 years' ineligibility are for his first-degree murder charge, while the other 10 years are for killing Brendon. In 2011, federal legislation was passed allowing courts to impose consecutive periods of parole ineligibility in cases where defendants have been convicted of multiple murders.",

Mother-of-two Cheryl Howe, 32, from Morecambe, was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) at the age of 12, and suffers from excessive hair growth on her face, breasts, stomach and legs. She has been fighting for six years for treatment on the NHS, spending \u00a32,000 a year on razors, and shaving up to three times a day. Scroll down for video . Cheryl, pictured with her daughter Sharon who is now 14, was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 12 . She\u00a0suffers from excessive hair growth on her face, breasts, stomach and legs . Along the way she's had support from celebrities such as Kym Marsh, Ted Robbins and Edwina Currie. She finally got approved for NHS funding for laser hair removal treatment, which costs a minimum of \u00a310,000. Cheryl has had initial appointments and is booked in for September this year.\u00a0She said: 'I'm going to be a real girl and I can't wait. 'I was in tears when I found out. I've suffered years and years of abuse and finally something is happening. 'My hair growth has cost me jobs, relationships - it even ruined my first few years with my daughter. I couldn't be a mum or a wife, because I just didn't feel like a woman.' Cheryl suddenly began growing hair on her chest and legs at the age of 12. She had heavy periods from the age of eight. The 32-year-old says her body hair, shown here growing on her arm, has cost her jobs and relationships . Cheryl fought for six years for treatment on the NHS before finally getting approved. She says she had to shave up to three times a day to keep her face, chin and neck stubble-free . The mother-of-two is booked in for the \u00a310,000 treatment in September this year, to tackle unsightly hair on her stomach, face and chest . She says: 'I was bullied and beaten up at school. I used to get called Gorilla and Cheesy Cheryl.' She was diagnosed with PCOS and doctors prescribed the contraceptive pill, believing that her problems would improve. Cheryl says: 'The pill didn't help at all. I had periods for 28 days a month and the hair just kept on growing. I had thick hair on my face, breasts, stomach and legs. 'My older brother, John, taught me how to shave my face and I had to shave two or three times a day.' Cheryl was warned she would be unlikely to be able to have a baby, but at 17, she had a one-night stand and gave birth to her daughter Sharon, now 14. Cheryl says: 'He was the first boy to ever show me any attention and I had a one-night stand. But I can't regret it, because my daughter came along.' But with so many personal issues of her own, Sharon struggled with motherhood. She walked out on her daughter, leaving her own mother to care for her. Her doctors believed she had suffered a nervous breakdown. She gradually formed a bond with her daughter - but doctors then found two cancerous tumours on her ovary. They were removed, and she was told she would be unable to conceive again. But in January 2008, she fell pregnant for a second time with her son, Jack, now six. This time, the bond was instant and she adored him. Cheryl says: 'Jack made me see life through his eyes. He would cuddle me and say: \"Mummy, I don't mind your prickles.\" 'His kindness melted my heart.' Cheryl with her son Jack, now six-years-old (left) and brother (right), called John, who taught her how to shave . Cheryl now has a great relationship with her children Sharon, 12, and Jack, six, pictured . But her relationship with Jack's father broke down, because, Cheryl says, he was unable to cope with her excess hair. She says: 'When we got together, he insisted he didn't mind. But no man likes to see their partner shaving their chest, boobs and chin. It drove us apart.' She has also been targeted by trolls on the internet. Following last year's Eurovision song contest, featuring bearded drag queen act Conchita Wurst, she received Facebook messages saying: 'Did you see yourself on television last night?' and 'Can you see the resemblance?' Cheryl says: 'I had messages pushed through my door and I became too afraid even to go out. I lost my job and my self-esteem was very low. 'But I got lots of support too. People from all over the world apologised for what was said to me. Even Conchita Wurst sent me a message saying \"I really apologise, you shouldn't be penalised.\" 'We are all unique. People should judge a person by who they are, not what they look like.' The Morecambe mother-of-two is pictured with her sisters Sheridan (left) and Danielle (right) Cheryl has constantly campaigned for treatment for women whose lives are blighted by the condition. She set up the Inspiration Foundation forum and support group, which currently has 7,000 girls and women with PCOS as members, and has had support from Edwina Currie, Kym Marsh and Ted Robbins. Cheryl also has a campaign page called\u00a0Stand Up To PCOS. She has now finally received confirmation that she will receive the funding for the treatment. She says: 'My daughter, Sharon, gave me a hug for the first time in years. I hope this might bring us closer. 'Jack says he loves me and my prickles. He doesn't mind how I look. 'This isn't cosmetic. I have a disfigurement. It's horrendous that I've had to wait so long for it. 'I just want to concentrate on the future now. I can't wait to be a real girl at last.'",

    "source": "Paris (CNN)Six survivors of the Paris kosher supermarket siege in January are suing a French media outlet for what they call dangerous live broadcasting during the hostage-taking. According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege. A 24-year-old supermarket employee, Malian-born Lassana Bathily, was hailed as a hero afterward when it emerged that he had risked his life to hide 15 customers from Coulibaly in the cold room. The hostage-taking was the culmination of three days of terror in Paris that began with the January 7 shooting of 12 people at the offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The two brothers blamed for that attack, Cherif and Said Kouachi, were killed on January 9 after a violent standoff at an industrial site. The terror attacks claimed the lives of 17 people and put France on a heightened state of alert. CNN's Ariana Williams reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.

Crowds cheered as\u00a0Pema Lama, 15, was pulled, dazed and dusty, from the rubble of a guesthouse in Kathmandu after he became 'pancaked' between two floors when the quake hit on Saturday. He was carried out on a stretcher by medics who had placed  an IV drip into his arm and a blue brace around his neck. He appeared stunned and his eyes blinked in the sunlight. His astonishing tale of survival came as a four-month-old baby was reunited with his mother after being rescued from the rubble of their house. Scroll down for videos . Miracle survival: Pema Lama, 15, is rescued from the collapsed Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu five days after becoming trapped in the rubble during the devastating earthquake that struck the country on Saturday . Emergency medical attention: The boy was carried out in a stretcher. His face was covered in dust and medics had put an IV drop into his arm and a brace around his neck . An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to free the trapped boy . The rescue was a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit on Saturday, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the poverty-stricken Himalayan nation . An American disaster response team had been working for several hours to try to the 15-year-old boy from the seven-storey\u00a0Hilton Guesthouse. Speaking shortly before he was rescued, Andrew Olvera, who was heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development, said: 'He's not too far down. 'But the floors have collapsed and he'd pancaked between them.' Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the scene. Two concrete floors were hanging down in front like curtains. 'The whole operation is dangerous,' he said. 'But its risk versus gain. To save a human life, we'll risk almost anything.' The boy had been 'pancaked' between two floors, according to Andrew Olvera, who is heading the team from the U.S. Agency for International Development who freed him . Twisted ropes of steel rebar were all that were holding huge concrete slabs from falling onto the teenager . Heroic effort: Members of the Nepalese Armed Police Force carry their officer as they cheer after successfully rescuing earthquake survivor Pema Lama, 15, from the collapsed Hilton Hotel in Kathmandu . Meanwhile, the mother of a baby rescued after being trapped in rubble  has told over her 'overwhelming' joy at being reunited with her child. Five-month-old Sonit Awal was pulled from the ruins of his family home after his heart-broken mother was forced to listen to his cries for 22 anguished hours. Today mother Rasmila Awal thanked 'God and the rescuers' for saving the infant from death. Mrs Awal, 35, tells MailOnline: 'I am so happy to have my baby back. I'm so happy that he is alive.' Sonish was asleep in his cot upstairs when the walls of his home came crashing down around him. His parents and older sister, aged 10, were outside when the tremor struck and desperately tried to reach him. Joy: Five-month-old Sonit Awal was pulled from the ruins of his family home after his heart-broken mother was forced to listen to his cries for 22 anguished hours . Relief: Sister Soniya Awal, 10, father Shyam Awal, 34, mother Rasmila Awal, 35, with baby Sonit Awal in front of their devastated house . Father Shyam Awal worked tirelessly with friends and neighbours to try to free the boy, digging with their bare hands through the rubble. But without the proper equipment it was impossible. The frantic mother could not sleep or eat throughout the 22-hour separation from her young son. She said: 'I could think of nothing else but trying to save my baby. I was very sad. I did not eat. I did not sleep. I could hear him crying from the ruins of our home.' However, following appeals for help, overstretched Nepalese troops arrived to finally embark on a coordinated rescue mission. Mr Awal, 34, a truck driver told MailOnline: 'The baby was saved by a cupboard. He had been lying in his bit by the side of the bed. 'When the walls fell down they knocked a cupboard over and it became wedged by the side of the bed. My son was safe with the cupboard protecting him.' Now the family are homeless and living in the street under a tarpaulin opposite their house. The once smart four-storey structure lies in ruins across the road. Rescued: This is the incredible moment that a four-month-old earthquake survivor was pulled alive from the rubble of his collapsed home following the 7.8-magnitude tremor which shattered Nepal . Saved: The baby boy, who emerged from the wreckage covered in dust, was miraculously found amid the devastation by rescue workers who heard the infant's faint cries . Second chance: The military search team had already scoured the area near to the child's home in Bhaktapur, Kathmandu, in the hope of finding the little boy. But they had moved on after believing he had not survived . Team work: The military team then found the young boy when they returned to the area for the second time . The gap showing the hole where the baby was buried alive for nearly one whole day after his home collapsed . Another survivor who was trapped under rubble next to dead bodies for 82 hours has had one of his legs amputated, it was revealed today. Rishi Khanal, 27, had just finished lunch at a hotel in Kathmandu  when the 7.8-magnitude quake caused the building to crumble around him. He became trapped with his foot crushed under rubble and stayed alive by drinking his own urine. Doctors said they were forced to amputate a leg because of damage from prolonged internal bleeding. Their survival stories are a rare bit of good news in a city that has known little but despair since the earthquake hit, leaving more than 5,500 people dead across the Himalayan nation. Today, rescuers toiled in pouring rain among the debris, but officials said the chance of finding any more survivors was bleak as the death toll neared 5,500. 'I was certain I was going to die': Rishi Khanal is carried out of a collapsed hotel in Kathmandu on a stretcher after being trapped under rubble for 82 hours following the earthquake that struck Nepal four days ago . Relief: Mr Khanal said he was surrounded by dead bodies. But he kept banging on the rubble all around him and eventually this brought a French rescue team that extracted him after an operation lasting many hours . While rescue teams were out in the capital Kathmandu despite the rain, helicopters could not fly to the worst-hit areas in the countryside of the impoverished Himalayan nation. 'There may not be any more survivors,' said Rameshwor Dandal, chief of the disaster management centre at Nepal's home ministry. 'The rain is adding to the problems. Nature seems to be against us.' Anger over the slow pace of the rescue flared yesterday with protests outside parliament. Villagers blocked trucks carrying supplies, demanding the government do more to hasten the distribution of aid that has flooded into the country but has been slow to reach those in need. An official from Nepal's home ministry said the number of confirmed deaths from Saturday's 7.8 magnitude earthquake had risen to 5,489 by Thursday morning. Almost 11,000 were injured, and more than 80 were also killed in neighbouring India and Tibet. Many people have been sleeping in the open after the quake - the United Nations has said 600,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. Workers excavate bodies as they take part in a rescue operation at Kolache-2 in Bhaktapur near Kathmandu . Countries and organisations around the world have rushed to help Nepal, where the massive 7.8 magnitude quake has killed around 5,000 people . A Nepalese woman holds her baby in front of the wreckage of a house destroyed by the quake in Gorkha . Lives ruined: People sort through the rubble of buildings which collapsed in Sathighar, north of Kathmandu . It has said eight million people have been affected, with at least two million in need of tents, water, food and medicines over the next three months. Dandal said foreign rescue teams had told him that their work is almost done because there is little chance of finding any survivors. Nepal is appealing to foreign governments for more helicopters. There are currently about 20 Nepali army, private and Indian army helicopters involved in rescue operations, according to Laxmi Prasad Dhakal, a home ministry official. China is expected to send helicopters today, he said. Prime Minister Sushil Koirala has told Reuters the death toll could reach 10,000, with information on casualties and damage from far-flung villages and towns yet to come in. Nepalese soldiers use lime powder as a prevention measure against disease at a  tent site in Kathmandu . People walk past a collapsed building in the UNESCO world heritage site of Bhaktapur outside Kathmandu . That would surpass the 8,500 who died in a 1934 earthquake, the last disaster on this scale to hit the nation of 28 million people sandwiched between India and China. In Kathmandu and other cities, hospitals quickly overflowed with injured soon after the quake, with many being treated out in the open or not at all. Guna Raj, who works for a Kathmandu-based NGO specialising in providing sanitation, said there have been outbreaks of diarrhoea in relief camps because of a shortage of toilets and clean water. 'In the next few days or weeks I am sure there will be an outbreak of epidemics,' said Raj, who is involved in the relief effort. Tensions between foreigners and Nepalis desperate for relief surfaced, rescuers said, as fresh avalanches were reported in several areas. Members of Israeli search-and-rescue group Magnus said hundreds of tourists, including about 100 Israelis, were airlifted out of Langtang in Rasuwa district, a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu hit by an avalanche on Tuesday. But at least two foreigners, whose nationalities were as yet unknown, were found dead, the home ministry said. Fights had broken out there because of food shortages, Magnus team member Amit Rubin said. One of the trekkers said there had also been scuffles over places on the rescue helicopters. The quake also triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 18 climbers and guides, including four foreigners, the worst disaster on the world's highest peak.",

    "source": "Tracy Walters, 48, (right) died after her husband Ian's (left) car veered off the M1 motorway last year . A church treasurer accused of killing his wife by deliberately smashing his 4x4 vehicle into a tree at 84mph has described their early sex life together as \u2018dramatic\u2019. Ian Walters is accused of murdering his wife of two years after their relationship had collapsed because she was no longer able to satisfy his sexual demands. Walters, who also worked as a driving test examiner, veered off the M1 on the way back from an unsuccessful \u2018make or break\u2019 trip with his wife Tracy, Leicester Crown Court has heard. The 51-year-old\u2019s Mitsubishi L200 Animal ploughed through undergrowth before hitting a tree \u2013 leaving Mrs Walters, 48, with serious injuries. She was flown to hospital by helicopter but died two days after the crash in March last year. Walters, who was also badly hurt in the incident, was charged with his wife\u2019s murder two months later \u2013 ten days after her funeral. The prosecution is claiming that conflict over sex was a main reason the couple\u2019s marriage had fallen apart. Charles Miskin, prosecuting, said earlier in the trial: \u2018One of the principal issues was sex. He seemed to want it all the time and she couldn\u2019t cope with his demands.\u2019 But giving evidence yesterday, Walters described his love life with Tracy as \u2018very fulfilling\u2019, adding: \u2018It was very exciting and adventurous. She taught me things I never knew. It was very refreshing and usually initiated by Tracy rather than myself.\u2019 Walters went on to say that when they had sex it tended to be \u2018long, dramatic and adventurous\u2019 but lacked the \u2018intimacy\u2019 he craved. He added: \u2018What I needed was intimacy. What I needed was more than the touching. I wanted to fall asleep in each other\u2019s arms.\u2019 Quizzed over texts Tracy had sent to friends complaining that Walters had made her feel like \u2018a sex object\u2019, Walters agreed with the defence counsel that \u2018his sex drive was higher than Tracy\u2019s\u2019. And he admitted that as their relationship had worn on their sex life had waned. The jury also heard that the couple had a \u2018troubled\u2019 relationship, with Mrs Walters telling relatives and police that her husband had been abusive to her. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . Mrs Walters, a keen horse rider,\u00a0was flown to hospital following the collision in Markfield, Leicester, but died two days later from her injuries . She made an application under \u2018Clare\u2019s Law\u2019 to discover if he had a violent past. The pair, who had both been married once before, had grown-up children from their previous relationships. They started dating in 2011, and got married a year later in Cyprus. Mr Miskin told the court that the abuse started almost straight away, with Mrs Walters showing relatives bruises she claimed her husband had inflicted. Mrs Walters also texted a relative of one of her sons just an hour before the crash to say: \u2018I need him arrested when I get back, but I am scared because he is so volatile and I don\u2019t want to wind him up.\u2019 The couple were returning to their home in Swindon when Walters suddenly swerved his car off the carriageway and into a tree. The prosecution claim that Mrs Walters \u2018couldn\u2019t cope with her husband\u2019s demands\u2019 in bed, and that Walters purposely crashed to show his wife \u2018who was in charge\u2019. But Walters is claiming that at the time of the crash he had been taking antidepressants which sometimes made him drowsy. He told the court that he could recall two times when he had fallen asleep at the wheel, the last of which was on a motorway in 2002. He said he had also had three fainting episodes in the two years prior to the crash. Walters denies murder. The trial continues. The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash .

    "source": "England international Sam Tomkins rejected an offer from Warrington in order to return to Wigan. The 2012 Super League Man of Steel is to cut short his stay in the NRL with New Zealand Warriors and rejoin his home-town club on a four-year contract from 2016. The announcement was made by Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan at half-time in Thursday night's First Utility Super League derby with Warrington, who were the other club after his signature once he announced he was returning to Super League. Sam Tomkins has agreed to rejoin Wigan after cutting short his stay in the NRL with New Zealand Warriors . 'Yes, I was speaking with a couple of clubs but it was always going to be between Wigan and Warrington,' Tomkins told Sky Sports News from Auckland. 'They showed a bit of interest and are successful. I thought about it but in the end the pull to go back to Wigan and play alongside my two brothers was too big. It's special playing alongside them - I've played alongside them in Super League but never together.' Tomkins, who left Wigan at the end of their 2013 Grand Final triumph, sought a release from the last 12 months of his three-year contract with the Auckland-based Warriors after becoming homesick. Wigan received a world record transfer fee, thought to be around \u00a3700,000, for Tomkins when they agreed to release him in September 2013 but retained first option to re-sign him in the event of him returning to Super League and have agreed a fee in excess of \u00a3200,000 to get him back. 'I am really happy to have this sorted and to be returning home to Wigan,' said Tomkins, who was greeted with a big cheer when he appeared on the big screen at the DW Stadium. Tomkins made 129 Super League appearances, scoring 107 tries, during his four-year stint at Wigan . 'All of my friends and family live in Wigan, a lot of them play for Wigan. It really was a no-brainer for me when I sat down and thought about things.' Tomkins, who celebrated his 26th birthday last month, becomes the third England international to rejoin Wigan in the last 12 months. Older brother Joel came back last June from a spell in rugby union with Saracens and prop forward Lee Mossop cut short his stay in the NRL with Parramatta at the end of last season. The return of Wigan's latest prodigal son was greeted with delight by home fans at the DW Stadium. Tomkins made his Wigan bow, at the age of 19, against Whitehaven in a fifth round Challenge Cup tie in May 2008, when he became the first player in rugby league history to score five tries on his first-grade debut. He went on to make 129 Super League appearances from 2009-13, in which he scored 107 tries. Thursday's announcement will signal the departure of Australian full-back Matt Bowen, who was signed as Tomkins' replacement, initially on a 12-month contract which was subsequently extended. The 26-year-old\u00a0sought a release from the Warriors after becoming homesick . Tomkins, currently recovering from a knee injury, added: 'It's been a fantastic experience to test myself in the NRL but the reality is I am 13,000 miles away from my friends and family. 'When I left Wigan I always knew in my heart that I would return to play for the club one day and I am very excited at the thought of returning to the DW Stadium and pulling on that famous jersey once again. 'I have really enjoyed my time in New Zealand and can't thank everyone enough here as they have all done so much to make me feel welcome here since my arrival last year. 'My sole focus for the remainder of 2015 is to help the Warriors make the play-offs as we look to mount a serious challenge for the NRL Premiership.' Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: 'Once I heard Sam was looking to come back to England next year I knew we had to pull out all the stops to have him here. He is one of our own and a truly world-class player. 'Sam knows what we are all about here at Wigan. He understands our culture and our systems and will slot perfectly back into my squad. 'My thanks go to our chairman Ian Lenagan and rugby director Kris Radlinski who have worked tirelessly to make this happen.'",

Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' and ruin a dieter's good intentions. The new research, done on fish and mice, could someday lead to pills that will be able to quieten that voice or increase its volume. The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. On the left, images of normal hypothalamus POMC cells from a developing mouse. On the right: when the gene for the transcription factor is deleted, the cells no longer make it . The research focused on POMC neurons, which are a structure called the hypothalamus, that send and receive signals to regulate appetite. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working properly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The new findings show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The team, led by the University of Michigan, looked at how a protein called a transcription factor, and two small stretches of DNA called enhancers, act as triggers for the Pomc gene. All three regulate how often and when the POMC cells use the gene to create the signal molecules that then go out to the body. That little voice inside your head that tells you to keep eating is, in fact, simply a cluster of around 10,000 brain cells. Now scientists believe they have found tiny triggers inside those cells that give rise to this 'voice' 'The POMC region is a central node of the brain's means for regulating body weight, in response to influences from the hormone leptin,' said Malcom Low, a professor in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology. Like signal lights that show pilots the path to an airport runway, enhancers guide proteins toward the gene so it can be read. Located deep inside the brain, in a structure called the hypothalamus, the cluster of POMC neurons act as a control center for feelings of fullness or hunger. They take in signals from the body, and send out chemical signals to regulate appetite and eating. When POMC neurons are absent, or not working correctly, animals and humans grow dangerously obese. The latest research show in animals that the same thing happens when certain genetic triggers inside the POMC cells aren't working. The researchers found that the two enhancers act in ways that complement one another, both encouraging the expression of the Pomc gene at key times. Mice born without both of them became obese \u2013 as if their Pomc gene had been deactivated. The protein that latches on to the enhancer, called a transcription factor, is also vital. In the new PNAS paper, the researchers report that the transcription factor Islet 1, encoded by the Isl1 gene, plays this important role for POMC. When the researchers blocked cells of the hypothalamus from making Islet 1 halfway through pregnancy, the fetal mice failed to develop any POMC cells. 'Taken together, this work represents the first example of a neuron-specific gene in vertebrates where we have found both the enhancers and a shared transcription factor that control gene expression in the developing brain and then throughout the life span of the adult,' says Low. Looking to see if the same factors do the same thing in humans will be more complex \u2013 and there may be other enhancers and transcription factors involved. But in theory, it could be possible to find drugs to increase the production of Pomc gene products, or to help silence it. 'For humans, Pomc regulation may be part of the equation of weight control,' says Low. 'We don't know, but we think it likely, that it may be similar to the mouse model, where its role is like a dial, with a linear relationship between the amount of Pomc expression and the degree of obesity.'",

    "source": "A Missouri inmate was executed Tuesday night for killing a man in a fit of rage over child support payments 16 years ago. Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri. His fate was sealed after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down several appeals, including one claiming Cole was mentally ill and unfit for execution. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri and was pronounced dead at 10.24pm, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri . He declined to order a last meal and received the day's inmate tray meal of a turkey and bologna sandwich, a cookie and fruit punch. He did not provide a final written statement, the spokesman said. Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read the following statement from Gov. Jay Nixon: 'Next week marks the observance of Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Week in Missouri, and tonight I ask the people of our state to especially remember Anthony Curtis, murdered by the man whose sentence was carried out tonight. 'Far too often, the names of those who are victims of violent crime, such as Anthony Curtis, are the names that are forgotten. 'Please join us in keeping Anthony Curtis and his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.' On Tuesday, Gov. Nixon refused a clemency petition that raised concerns about the fact that Cole, who was black, was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. Cole and his wife, Terri, were married for 11 years and had two children before divorcing in 1995. The couple fought about visitation and he was upset about child support payments, authorities said. By 1998, Cole was $3,000 behind in child support. Attorney General Chris Koster said Cole became angry when he learned that a payroll withholding order was issued to his employer, taking the money out of his check. 'Before I give her another dime, I'll kill (her),' Cole told co-workers, according to Koster. The first deduction appeared on his August 21, 1998, paycheck. Hours later, Cole forced his way into his ex-wife's home by throwing a tire jack through a glass door, Koster said. He was confronted by Curtis, a friend who was visiting. Andre Cole used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Curtis, then Terri Cole. Curtis died but Terri Cole survived. Cole fled the state but surrendered 33 days later. He claimed at trial that he did not bring a weapon into Terri Cole's house and that Curtis initiated the attack with a knife. Andre Cole's brother, DeAngelo Cole, 38, of Las Vegas, said the attack was out of character for his sibling. He called it a crime of passion. 'It was a one-time thing,' DeAngelo Cole said. 'He didn't have a history of that kind of behavior.' Cole's attorney, Joseph Luby, said Cole's mental health deteriorated during the more than a decade he spent in prison. He said Cole was plagued by psychosis and constantly heard voices in his head. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (above) in Bonne Terre, Missouri . The courts were not convinced. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the execution based on mental health concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned away appeals based on Missouri's secretive method of obtaining the execution drug pentobarbital and over how instructions were given to the jury. The jury itself was the source of the clemency request to Nixon. Advocates for Cole, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, said his case was among many in which St. Louis County prosecutors unfairly prohibited black jurors from hearing a death penalty case involving a black suspect. All 12 jurors in Cole's case were white. Kimber Edwards, who was scheduled for execution in May, was also convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. The Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation, canceled the execution orders for Edwards earlier this month. Missouri tied Texas for the most executions in 2014 with 10. Missouri has now executed 15 men since November 2013.",

Tebow, 27, hasn't played a snap in the NFL in over two years since being cut by the New England Patriots before the 2013 season. The team announced the contract Monday but did not disclose the financial terms of the deal the club reached with the\u00a02007 Heisman Trophy winner. Scroll down for video . The Philadelphia Eagles officially signed 27-year-old quarterback Tim Tebow to a one-year deal on Monday . Tebow hasn't played a snap in the NFL since being cut by the New England Patriots before the 2013 season . Originally a first-round draft choice  of the Denver Broncos in 2010, the\u00a06-3, 236-pound Tebow worked out with the . Eagles last month and must have impressed Philadelphia head coach Chip Kelly. Philadelphia . missed out on the playoffs despite compiling a 10-6 record and Kelly has made a number of surprising roster moves this offseason. The Eagles already have four other quarterbacks on their roster: Sam Bradford, Mark Sanchez, Matt Barkley and G.J. Kinne. Bradford and Tebow faced each other in the\u00a02009 BCS National Championship Game. Tebow's Florida Gators defeated Bradford and the No. 1 ranked Oklahoma Sooners 21-14. Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper went to Florida and was Tebow's roommate in college. Former Patriot and convicted murderer Aaron Hernandez was also Tebow's\u00a0college teammate. Fans can already purchase a Nike Tim Tebow midnight green Philadelphia Eagles game jersey for $99.95. He will wear No. 11 with the team. News of the deal leaked Sunday, the same day Tebow tweeted: 'Be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you. Ephesians 4:32.' Tebow has thrown 173 completions, 17 touchdowns and nine interceptions in 35 games in the NFL . Tebow hasn't played in a regular season game since 2012 when he was with the New York Jets. He worked as a television analyst last year with the SEC Network and ESPN. Before signing his deal, Tebow was working out with noted throwing coach Tom House, according to the Eagles. His accuracy and skill as a NFL-caliber passer has been questioned since he was drafted. Tebow is still highly popular after leading Florida to two national titles and spending two seasons with Denver. He helped the Broncos win an AFC West title and won a playoff game before being dealt to the Jets after the 2011 season when Peyton Manning arrived in Denver . Many fans follow Tebow because of his strong Christian beliefs. A native of Jacksonville, Florida, Tebow has served as the chairman for the Tim Tebow Foundation since its inception in 2010.",

Hamilton spearheaded a Mercedes one-two at the Shanghai International Circuit, claiming his fourth Chinese Grand Prix victory and the 35th overall of his Formula One career. Rosberg, though, effectively accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference after the reigning champion slowed in the middle stint of the race to preserve his soft tyres. Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda (right) pictured by the circuit in his recognisable red cap . Nico Rosberg speaks with Lauda in the team garage... the German is expected to turn 'nasty' at some stage . That backed up Rosberg who had Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel closing in from behind, forcing him to bemoan the situation to the team over the radio, who responded by asking Hamilton to increase his pace. Rosberg made his feelings plain to Hamilton immediately afterwards, yet the 30-year-old was completely exonerated of any wrongdoing. As far as Mercedes non-executive chairman Lauda was concerned, the actions of Hamilton were that of a driver with a winning mentality. 'We were first and second and I don't care if there is a quarrel, as long as Vettel was third,' said Lauda. 'One thing is clear from my point of view, Lewis had pole position and controlled the race from the beginning to the end, therefore there is no need for a quarrel.' Asked whether Hamilton had the right to be selfish, Lauda replied: 'Sure, he will drive selfish. 'These guys... I call them egocentric b*******, and this is the only way to win a championship. It's the oldest thing. There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that's it.' Lewis Hamilton waves to the crowd from the podium as Rosberg reflects on finishing behind his team-mate . Hamilton and Rosberg spray champagne from the podium as Mercedes celebrate a one-two finish . Hamilton celebrates his win with the Mercedes team but Rosberg appears less pleased with second . Hamilton backed his corner when it was claimed that he had scuppered his team-mate's race . Lauda rightly noted Rosberg opted not to attack Hamilton for the win, instead wanting to preserve his own tyres and hang on to second. The three-times champion, however, believes Rosberg will hit back at some stage, adding: 'Nico will calm himself down. 'For sure, when you are being beaten by your team-mate it hurts. When I was being beaten by (Alain) Prost all the time I was not happy. On the other hand Nico is a guy who comes back quickly, so thank God there is only one week to the next race (in Bahrain) so all this talk will stop quickly when they start driving again on Friday. 'Of course, Lewis bites, he has the talent to bite, but Nico is as nasty as he is if he sees the chance. Don't worry.' It means Rosberg could respond in Bahrain, the scene of their titanic on-track duel last season which sparked their at-times bitter rivalry which culminated in their collision in Belgium. For now, Hamilton holds a 13-point cushion to Vettel, with Rosberg a further four points adrift. Hamilton crossed the line to claim his second win of the season and his fourth in China . Rosberg accused Hamilton of selfishness during the post-race press conference on Sunday . Overall, Hamilton said: 'I'm really happy. It was a great race and really positive to have a clean weekend throughout every session.' Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth ahead of Williams pair Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, with McLaren's Fernando Alonso 12th and Jenson Button 14th. Button had finished 13th, but was handed a five-second post-race penalty for an accident with Lotus' Pastor Maldonado that ended the Venezuelan's grand prix. In his first race with Manor, after missing the first two due to issues, Will Stevens was 15th, finishing ahead of team-mate Roberto Merhi.",

Retirement beckons for McCoy, champion jockey every year since he first won the title in 1997, and he will stop riding immediately if his mount Shutthefrontdoor wins the \u00a31million Crabbie\u2019s Grand National on Saturday. AP McCoy celebrates Grand National victory on Don\u2019t Push It in 2010 . Shutthefrontdoor, trained by Jonjo O\u2019Neill, will be the subject of an avalanche of emotional support and many once-a-year punters will pin their hopes on McCoy delivering a result like he did in 2010 when he won this famous race on Don\u2019t Push It. In a perfect world, the National will finish with McCoy standing high in his irons celebrating but he, more than anyone, knows nothing is guaranteed in a sport as unpredictable as jump racing. It won\u2019t, however, stop the 40-year-old hoping his script has a glorious finale. \u2018I\u2019m a dreamer,\u2019 said McCoy, who announced his plans to retire in February. \u2018I\u2019m a believer \u2013 I always have been. McCoy seeks to end record-breaking career with victory on Shutthefrontdoor\u00a0in the Grand National . 'If everyone has gone to bed thinking the dream will\u00a0happen, I can promise you nobody has been dreaming more than me. In some ways, I regret making the announcement to retire when I did. I\u2019ve thought to myself I should have just kept quiet. But in other ways I think it has been good. \u2018If it\u2019s created publicity for racing and helped get interest in the sport, so much the better. \u2018Racing has been good to me and if this has been me giving something back, great. If people are putting money on Shutthefrontdoor in the hope I win for the fairytale, let me assure them nobody will be wanting me to win more than I do. People talk about me having ridden more winners than anyone else but I\u2019ve also ridden more losers than anyone else.

Mention of that brought a wry smile from McCoy. \u2018I wish it was as straightforward as running around a couple of bends at Ascot!\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve got 30 fences and 38 other horses in my way!

    "source": "The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are so desperate to rid themselves of Major League Baseball star Josh Hamilton that they might decide to pay almost $70million for him to play for another team. Hamilton, who has a history of substance abuse and admitted to relapsing with drugs and alcohol in February, is going to be sent back to his former team, the Texas Rangers, according to reports. He has been on the disabled list all season after undergoing shoulder surgery on February 4, about the same time he filed for divorce from Real Housewives of Orange County star Katie Hamilton. Scroll down for video . The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are willing to pay almost $70million for Josh Hamilton to play in Texas . Josh Hamilton filed for divorce from his wife, Katie, in late February after they celebrated ten years together . The 33-year-old (pictured) was an All Star during a five-year span with the Texas Rangers from 2008 until 2012 . The 33-year-old outfielder still has about $83million left on the five-year $125million deal he signed with the Angels in 2012. In order for the Angels to rid themselves of Hamiton, they would have to agree to pay out the bulk of the cash remaining on his contract, according to MLB.com. The Rangers are only willing to pay around $15million to Hamilton and do not want to give up any players in a trade with Los Angeles, Sports Illustrated reported. The Angels would effectively be paying $68million for Hamilton to play in Texas. Yahoo MLB columnist Jeff Passan said on Twitter: 'Angels wanted Josh Hamilton gone and are paying ~$65M to make it happen. 'Rangers get a $15M lottery ticket that could be worth much more.' Details of the trade and/or buyout are still being negotiated but an announcement is expected in the next few days unless things fall apart. Hamilton is no longer allowed to see any of his daugthers without supervision, according to court records . If it goes through, the Rangers will happily welcome Hamilton back. Shortstop Elvis Andrus said:\u00a0'He is a player who can help everybody. The deal could stall, but Hamilton is likely going back to Texas. He won MVP there in 2010 . 'He is a guy that we know.\u00a0When he is at his best, we know what he can do. 'It's not the first time something happened with him outside the field. 'We all did a great job here having his back and supporting him. 'As long as he shows up and plays hard, I will always have his back.' Hamilton had been spending the offseason in Houston recovering from surgery to repair the AC joint in his right shoulder when reports began to surface about his drug relapse. He is still rehabbing from the procedure and could return in May. During his time with Texas, Hamilton hit .305 with 142 home runs, 506 RBIs and a .549 slugging percentage . The Rangers are willing to pay around $15million to Hamilton and won't give up any players to Los Angeles . Hamilton filed for divorce from wife Katie in February, around the same time he self-reported a cocaine and alcohol relapse. They married in 2004 and have three daughters together, but court documents show Hamilton is not allowed to see them without supervision. Katie, who will appear on the 10th season of The Real Housewives of Orange County when it airs this summer, has a daughter from a previous relationship. The divorce petition only cited 'conflict' as the reason for the split. The veteran outfielder was suspended for three seasons between 2003-05 for well-documented issues with substance abuse and undergoes regular drug testing as a condition of his reinstatement into baseball in 2005. The slugger beat his early addiction problems and became one of the game's most feared hitters over a five-year span with the Texas Rangers from 2008-12. Hamilton was named an American League All-Star in each of those seasons and captured the AL MVP award in 2010. MLB officials thought Hamilton violated his treatment with the relapse, but the players' association disagreed . The Hamiltons, pictured last year, have not listed the reasons behind their divorce, citing only 'conflict' MLB officials thought Hamilton violated his treatment program with the recent relapse, but the players' association disagreed. After league and union representatives were unable to reach an agreement in the case, an arbitrator was called in. The arbitrator said Hamilton did not violate terms of the agreement, although the reasoning behind the decision was not divulged. Major League Baseball released a statement saying it disagreed with the arbitrator's decision. When the decision was announced,\u00a0Angels general manager Jerry DiPoto said: 'The Angels have serious concerns about Josh's conduct, health and behavior and we are disappointed that he has broken an important commitment which he made to himself, his family, his teammates and our fans,' 'We are going to do everything possible to assure he receives proper help for himself and for the well-being of his family.' Plagued by injuries last season, Hamilton had only 381 at-bats and posted ten home runs, 44 runs batted in and a .263 batting average. He has a career batting average of .292, has hit as many as 43 home runs in a season (2012) and in 2008 drove in a league-leading 130 runs. During his time with the Rangers, Hamilton batted .305 with 142 home runs, 506 RBIs and a .549 slugging percentag .",

Romantic Ben Parsons, 34, of Brighton, East Sussex, stunned girlfriend Anna Jefferson, 36, by getting down on one knee after running 24 and a half miles. She was watching her boyfriend run in the Brighton marathon with their children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months. Ben Parson, 34, paused in the middle of the Brighton marathon and proposed to his surprised girlfriend, Anna Jefferson, 36 . Anna feared her boyfriend was struggling when he started to slow down on Hove seafront, because she was unaware of his proposal plan. Ben then got down on one knee and popped the question and Anna said yes, before Ben ran onward towards the finishing line, still managing to get a personal best timing and completing his sixth Brighton Marathon in 3hrs 36min. Ben, a media law lecturer at the University of Brighton, carried the ring in his bum bag and waited to spot Anna in the crowd on Sunday. He said: 'I wanted to do something romantic to surprise Anna and the marathon has such a feelgood, loved-up atmosphere anyway so I knew it would be the perfect time. Ben Parson had already run 24.5 miles of the 26.2-mile Brighton marathon when he stopped to propose to girlfriend and mother of his two children, Anna Parsons . At the time, Anna had been stood in the crowds with children Nancy, three, and Thomas, 11 months . 'Judging by the look on her face, she was certainly surprised. 'Once Anna had said 'yes' and we'd had a big sweaty hug I had to get on the move again so my legs wouldn't seize up. 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com. 'I had an extra spring in my step for the last mile and a half.' 'As I ran off I got a big cheer from the crowd. It felt like the climax of a minor British rom-com': After Anna said yes, Ben carried on with the marathon . He said that the pressure of the proposal spurred him on and brought the finishing line a bit closer. But he joked: 'If I hadn't seen her in the crowd maybe I would have just carried on to the end and taken the ring back to Argos.' Anna, who works for Arts Council England, and has been dating Ben since they met at City College Brighton in 2002, said she never expected the proposal. She said: 'There had been a guy just before him who had got a cramp and had to stop for his friends to massage his leg. Newly-engaged: The happy couple are stood after the surprise proposal with their two children . 'Then Ben started slowing down and I thought 'oh god he's going to collapse or something'. 'I had no idea what he was planning. 'In hindsight he had suggested before that I wear something nice so we could go out for something to eat afterwards. I should really have twigged when he asked me to take his brogues in the bottom of the pram. 'Who wears brogues after running a marathon?'",

    "source": "After weeks of being hounded  for a comment on the expected birth of the new royal baby, Mel Greig has written an open letter to the media, warning of the harmful consequences of always seeking for a new angle on world events. The former 2Day FM co-host, who shot to notoriety in 2012 after a prank\u00a0call during the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy resulted in the death of the nurse who took the call, penned the letter to ask the media, 'Have we not learnt enough from the royal prank call?'. The 33-year-old said in the letter that with the impending birth of the second child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she understood the pressure of needing to find 'a new angle' when providing coverage of news events, offering assurance that she had been in the same position. Scroll down for video . Former Australian radio host Mel Greig has written an open letter to the media, warning of the harmful consequences of always seeking for a new angle on world events . 'I sat there and agreed to prank call a hospital to create a \u201cunique angle\u201d a harmless and stupid idea that sadly ended in tragedy, as we felt obliged to cover the pregnancy and to do it differently,' she wrote in the letter published by The Daily Telegraph. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be overdue by five days as she had been due to give birth last Thursday . Greig and fellow 2Day FM co-host Michael Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of the prank in 2012 to gain information about the Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of Prince George. Jacintha Saldana was the nurse who took the call at King Edward Hospital in London, taking her life two days later and blaming her decision on the actions of the Australian radio hosts. Greig has since revealed her personal torment over the prank, and was unable to return to her role on the air, saying earlier in the year that she felt 'the world hated [her]' for what had happened. In the letter, Greig asks why the media continues to seek fresh angles for stories after seeing the consequences of her mistake, and asks various media outlets to learn from the tragedy of Ms Saldana's death and to be sensible when it comes to covering the birth of the second royal baby. 'Respect their privacy, stay away from the hospital and think of others when working out what angles to pursue. For anyone that is actually considering trying to repeat our stupidity from 2012, DON\u2019T,' Greig wrote. She declared in the letter that there was no need for a fresh angle on the birth, as the fact that a new baby was being born was sufficient, and that her only response would be to congratulate the parents. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to be five days overdue, and many fans and media have camped outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where she will give birth. The 33-year-old said that while she thought the media industry was 'wonderful', she said that there needs to be a 'line' that is never crossed when reporting news. Greig goes on to recount the moment when her own family was hounded by someone she knew when her father and her whole street was 'doorknocked' for information following the scandal in 2012. 'I\u2019ve crossed the line too. But the difference is, I\u2019ve learnt from it and I\u2019ll continue to work in the media so I can help others to think before they act. You don\u2019t need to be careless to create great content,' she finished. Jacintha Saldana committed suicide two days after taking the prank call and blamed the radio hosts . Kate and William leave St Mary's Hospital in Paddington shortly after the birth of Prince George. One midwife suggests cleaning Kensington Palace could help induce labour . The Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where the Duchess will give birth. The facility don't normally wait for more than a week before helping the baby along . The Duchess of Cambridge's royal\u2019s baby is expected before the end of April - with the due date initially reported as yesterday, but later claimed to actually be as early as Wednesday last week. Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Earlier in the year, Greig spoke to BBC2 Radio and spoke of her continual anguish over her actions in 2012. 'I was in disgust with myself, I had failed as a human being, to be involved in someone's death is horrific and it affected me greatly,' she told BBC2 Radio listeners. While Ms Greig said that she now understands that 'there is more to mental health...it's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide,' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time. Ms Greig said she had experienced deep depression for a year, and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently. Last year, Ms Greig said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever, but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family. Kate and William with Prince George in a picture to mark his first birthday. It is thought their second child is now overdue . The new royal baby's big brother Prince George was three days overdue when he was born on July 22, 2013 . 'I don\u2019t know how you completely forgive yourself \u2013 someone wrote my name in their suicide note,' she told Sunrise. 'They thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but I can move forward from that point I think because I've tried to say sorry.' 'It was really tough but I made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers I would go to the inquest so I was always going to go,' she said. 'To be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it\u2019s something I felt I needed to do \u2013 everyone was very emotionally involved in that room.' Ms Greig now hopes she can try to move on with her life. 'I do have a little bit more closure and I\u2019ve been finding it so hard to move forward and I think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry \u2013 just bearing that guilt and that blame,' she said. 'To know that I have done everything I can \u2013 I tried to help \u2013 I said sorry \u2013 I feel that I've redeemed myself as much as I can and I hope they got the answers to find the closure as well.' Former 2Day FM co-hosts Greig (left) and Michael Christian (right) posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of a prank in 2012 . Ms Greig said that the incident had changed her forever and that she felt like the 'world hated [her]' When asked how others involved in the prank had been able to put the tragedy behind them, Ms Greig simply replied that people handle situations differently. 'Some people were able to just move on from that \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013 it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it,' she said. 'As well, knowing Jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly \u2013 you hold yourself responsible.' Ms Greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years. 'It took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and I wanted to fight - life is so precious,' she said. 'I wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined I feel I\u2019ve got everything so I can truly move forward.'",

    "source": "Killer cop Michael Slager is not eligible for South Carolina's death penalty even if he is convicted of murder, according to local prosecutors. The North Charleston police officer can't be executed for shooting Walter Scott in the back because the killing did not include any of a list of narrowly-defined 'aggravating circumstances' which\u00a0state law\u00a0says are conditions of the death penalty. It came as evidence against Slager continues to mount, the latest of which is dash cam footage of him discharging a Taser into a black man's back filed as part of an excessive force lawsuit. The video shows Slager weighing in on an arrest in progress, announcing that he's going to Tase Julius Garnett Wilson, who is laying on the floor, then discharging his weapon. Taser: Michael Slager, the North Charleston cop charged with murder, is pictured above firing a Taser at a black man being held down by two fellow officers. The man being stunned is now filing a lawsuit . Killing: Slager is being held in prison on murder charges after this video emerged of him shooting derad 50-year-old Walter Scott . As Wilson writhes on the floor he then yells 'turn over or you're going to get it again' in the footage, dated August 2014. Wilson, who was pulled over on his way to work at 4am for having a faulty tail light, is seen on dash cam recording insisting he has done nothing wrong, and demanding to know why he is being placed under arrest. Charges: Slager is facing an accusation of murder - but won't face the death penalty . The two officers, including Slager, don't explain and instead demand that he get out of the car. After one points a gun at him, he is seen being pulled out of the car. According to ABC News4, the officer in question said he drew his pistol after Wilson reached for something in the car. A third officer then arrives, and takes over from Slager attempting to subdue Wilson. Slager then warns his fellow officers to stand back before discharging the Taser. Attorneys for Wilson allege that his civil rights were breached, according to the New York Times. Wilson was charged with driving under suspension and resisting arrest. He pleaded guilty to resisting arrest, but the driving charge was later dropped. Other lawsuits against Slager are likely to follow in the light of his highly-publicized killing of Scott, a 50-year-old father of four. Mario Givens, who files an excessive force complaint against Slager in 2013, also said he intends to mount another case. Givens says that Slager knocked on his door and threatened him with the Taser unless he put his hands on his head. When he did, Givens claims Slager used the Taser on him anyway. Slager was looking for Givens's brother, Matthew, who is significantly shorter than him. Killed: Walter Scott, pictured above left and right, was shot dead by police officer Michael Slager on April 4 . A murder indictment and any trial for Slager is still months away - but prosecutors have already said that there is no chance he will be executed. Charleston County's chief prosecutor Scarlett Wilson made the point Monday, after media reporting on the shooting widely pointed out that South Carolina law does include the death penalty. However, she said Monday that 'based on the facts received thus far, it does not appear South Carolina's death penalty provision applies in this case'. The state law\u00a0which outlines the possible punishment for murder lists 12 'aggravating circumstances' which enable the death penalty. Some include other crimes being carried out at the same time, including torture, rape, drug trafficking, kidnapping, burglary and arson. Other provisions allow the death penalty if the victim is a child, a police officer, witness or court official, and if the crime is part of a mass murder. Scott's death reignited a public outcry over police . treatment of minorities that flared last year after the killings . of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City, and . elsewhere. North Charleston fired Slager last week after he was charged . with murder. A cellphone video showed him shooting at Scott's . back eight times as he ran away. Slager, who was being held in Charleston County jail, could . face 30 years to life in prison if convicted. A spokesman for the North Charleston police department . declined to comment.",

    "source": "An amateur cyclist is planning to ride the entire Tour de France - considered the most gruelling race in professional cycling - on a Raleigh Chopper. Dave Sim has put in months of training aboard his bright yellow Mark Three Chopper in preparation to ride all 2077 miles of the 2015 Tour de France route this summer. The 36-year-old personal trainer from Southport, Merseyside, is hoping his stunt will inspire people to get out and ride themselves. Scroll down for video . Dave Sim, 36, rides his Raleigh Chopper on the L'Etape du Tour last year. He now hopes to cycle the entire Tour de France . The tour involves many hill climbs which are grueling even for professionals using high-performance road bikes . Mr Sim and two others, who are using proper road bikes, attempt a hill climb in France last year . Mr Sim said his Chopper is as close to standard as possible, but required a better seat and tweaked brakes . Mr Sim said his Chopper - the 2004 revival of the iconic 1970's children's bike - is as close to standard as possible. He said: 'I've tried to make as few changes as possible so it's got the original tyres. 'The main thing I've changed is the seat post and the pedal arms as it was originally designed for kids. 'And the wheels - on the first part of the race through Northern France, there are a lot of sections of really terrible cobbles, so a guy made me some really strong wheels as I kept breaking spokes. 'I've also had to put slightly better brakes on as well. 'Up the biggest climbs it gets a bit grim, it was just two degrees at the top of one, the Col de Tourmalet - it took me forever to get down, I was almost hypothermic at the bottom.' While it's by far the longest ride he's attempted, Mr Sim has completed long rides on the Chopper before. Mr Sim attempted the L'Etape du Tour on the Raleigh Chopper last year and finished in the top 20 per cent . Mr Sim hopes his audacious attempt to ride the Tour de France will inspire others to take up cycling . Pictured left, Mr Sim stands with others riding the L'Etape du Tour. Right, he is pictured with his Chopper in the Lake District . He said: 'I did the L'Etape du Tour last year it's a mass start event where thousands do a stage of the Tour de France on closed roads. 'Lots of people didn't think I could do it, but I thought, why not have a go? 'I did really well, got a really good time, I was in the top 20 per cent, so the next morning, I thought about doing the full tour. 'I thought, if I could do one day, is it possible to do the whole tour? 'After the Etape I shouldn't have wanted to even see a Chopper again, but it was a bit of a Eureka moment, that's where it came from. 'I come from a cycling family, my mum and dad would take me to see the Tour, riding up mountains is in my blood. 'It's always been a bit of a dream to ride the Tour de France, I won't do it again, my dad said he never would have thought I'd do it on a chopper!' He said: 'Part of the motivation was to show people you don't need a \u00a310,000 bike to do amazing things on - my bike cost me \u00a3100, and I'm doing the Tour on it. With a bike, it's mostly to do with the engine. 'In the last five years the cost of road cycling has sky rocketed but you don't need all that, you just need to get out and ride. 'The other side of the challenge is to raise as much money for Help for Heroes as possible.' Mr Sim also hopes his stunt will raise as much money as possible for charity Help for Heroes .",

    "source": "Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America. A pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public. An overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy April afternoon at W.O.R.D. Ministries Christian Center in Summerville, which has a capacity of about 300 people. The flag-draped casket of the U.S. Coast Guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as Scott's relatives and friends followed. Some dabbed tears; others embraced. Hundreds, including local officials, assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors, under an awning at the entrance, wherever they could stand. Silence filled the vast space as Scott's daughter Samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father. Anthony Scott said God had selected his brother as a candidate for change in America. \"The change will come,\" he said, bringing to the crowd to its feet. The head of the church, George Hamilton, spoke of how Scott had brought members of his family to the church, of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video. The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was \"motivated by racial prejudice,\" Hamilton said. It was \"an act of overt racism.\" \"Hate came because Walter was an African-American,\" he said. Hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement, but he singled out the officer who killed Scott as a \"disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department.\" \"There is gong to be change,\" he said. \"Walter's death will not be in vain.\" After the service, pallbearers gently lifted Scott's casket into the hearse. Crowds poured from the church. A slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to Live Oak Memorial Gardens in Charleston for the private burial. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue. \"It's a human issue,\" he said. \"We're getting emails from people in Arkansas telling us, 'I'm a white male, and I'm supporting this family.' Their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other.\" On Friday night, Scott's open casket was draped with an American flag, and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in Charleston. A Dallas Cowboys banner -- his favorite NFL team -- was placed outside the casket, and a figurine of a Cowboys player stood at his side. But Scott's family was missing. They needed privacy, said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley, who attended. A week ago, Scott was killed in North Charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight. A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder. He was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted. Who was Walter Scott? The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots. Scott is struck five times; he falls to the ground. \"Nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer's life or the life of another was threatened,\" National Urban League President Marc Morial said. \"The question here is whether the use of force was excessive.\" But one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting. And at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up. On Thursday, Gwen Nichols told CNN's Brian Todd that she saw Scott and Slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot. \"It was like a tussle type of thing, like, you know, like, 'What do you want?' or 'What did I do?' type of thing,\" Nichols said. \"I didn't hear Mr. Slager saying 'Stop!' \" Nichols' account has similarities to Slager's. He had told investigators that he had tussled with Scott over his Taser and that he feared for his safety. A timeline of events . Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case. \"Defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- (that) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation, a physical altercation with a suspect,\" Callan said. \"And that would constitute manslaughter under law, as opposed to murder, and it makes a huge difference in sentencing.\" In South Carolina, a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation. But the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video, Feidin Santana, paints a different picture. He was walking to work when he saw Slager on top of Scott, he said, who was on the ground. Santana said he could hear the sound of a Taser in use. He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed. He said he believes Scott was trying to get away. \"Mr. Scott never tried to fight,\" Santana said. Neither the struggle nor the use of a Taser was captured on video, because Santana started recording shortly after that. Investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start, it said in a statement. \"We believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter,\" division Chief Mark Keel said in a statement. \"The cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions.\" Slager's lawyer, Andy Savage, has complained that he \"has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has.\" Savage's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \"any investigative documents, audio or video tapes, other than a copy of Mr. Slager's arrest warrant.\" The news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that Slager belongs to \"is no longer involved in the case.\" Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon said Slager's wife, Jamie, who is eight months' pregnant, and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center Friday.  Slager was being held in isolation and being \"monitored for his mental health,\" Cannon said. In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour. \"His wife and mom were tearful but strong, and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person, even if separated by a thick pane of glass,\" the statement said. \"They held up family photos -- and even Jamie's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him. Throughout the visit, Michael was focused on Jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families.\" A second video, taken from a police dash cam, has also emerged from the day Scott died. It shows moments before  the shooting, when things seemed to be going smoothly between Scott and Slager. Scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle, and Slager returns to his car to do paperwork. Then Scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera's frame. Scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop, according to court records. That was why he ran, lawyers for the family said after the funeral service. U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, D-South Carolina, told reporters outside the service that Scott lost a $35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support. \"He said it was the best job he's ever had,\" Clyburn said. \"Now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support, there's got to be income. And you ain't going to make much income from jail. It seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom.\" On Friday afternoon, police met with a man who was in Scott's car, but the passenger's name wasn't in a police report obtained by CNN. He was detained briefly after the shooting, one officer wrote in the report. Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend. But he did not identify the passenger by name. On Friday, a few mourners trickled into the Fielding Home for Funerals. A white banner with a blue star near Scott's casket displayed his favorite NFL team. It said: \"Tradition, the Cowboys way.\" \"This is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community,\" said Riley, the mayor. \"It breaks everyone's hearts.\" CNN's Polo Sandoval and Martin Savidge reported from Charleston, and Ben Brumfield and Ray Sanchez reported and wrote in Atlanta and New York.",

    "source": "(CNN)Arizona investigators have released dramatic video of a Walmart parking lot brawl that left a police officer wounded, one man dead, and reportedly involved members of a Christian family band. Enoch Gaver, 21, was killed in the fight in the town of Cottonwood, and suspect David Gaver, 28, was shot in the stomach and taken into custody.  Police Sergeant Jeremy Daniels was hit in the leg by a bullet fired during the melee. The police dashcam video, released Friday, shows Cottonwood Police approaching the group of eight people -- all identified as members of the Gaver family -- around a large SUV in a Walmart parking lot on March 21. Officers wanted to question them about the alleged assault of a Walmart employee who was going into the store bathroom. The police were accompanied by another Walmart employee. On the video, an officer tells the group that they \"need to separate these folks and talk to them.\" Someone then responds, \"No, you are not going to separate me from my parents,\" and, \"don't touch me.\" The video then shows a police officer being put in a headlock and knocked to the ground. The sound of Taser fire is heard. Police say pepper spray was deployed and that at least three shots were fired in an apparent struggle for an officer's gun. Several times on the video the group appears to surrender, but starts fighting again. The melee goes for several minutes until backup officers arrive and make arrests. Police charged four members of the family with assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. Two minors were also taken into custody and are being held at a juvenile detention facility. At least three members of the family are reportedly in a Christian band named \"Matthew 24 Now,\" which is a Bible verse that refers to the end times, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. The family was living out of its Chevy Suburban. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.",

The 24-year-old Liverpool midfielder put pen to paper on Thursday morning on a deal worth more than \u00a3100,000 per week that will keep him at Anfield until the summer of 2020. Henderson\u2019s current terms had 12 months to run but leaving Merseyside was never an option. Henderson is the latest big name in Brendan Rodgers\u2019 squad to commit his future to the club \u2013 deals for Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge were completed earlier in the campaign. Jordan Henderson is 'over the moon' after signing a new long-term contract with Liverpool . The club's vice captain puts pen to paper on a deal which will keep him at Liverpool until 2020 . Henderson seen in training for Liverpool at Melwood on Thursday afternoon . Henderson shakes hands with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard during training at Melwood . Liverpool, who are expected to confirm that Jordon Ibe has signed a similar long-term extension before the end of the week, have been in negotiations since the start of the season with Henderson\u2019s advisers. He has not let the talks distract his focus and  has been one of Liverpool\u2019s most consistent players, producing 13 assists and seven goals from midfield and, significantly, being promoted to the role of vice captain. Rodgers will consider Henderson for the role of club captain after Steven Gerrard moves to LA Galaxy at the end of the campaign but, for now, the England international is delighted to have agreed terms on a contract that will take him through the peak years of his career. \u2018I\u2019m over the moon that it\u2019s all done just so I can concentrate on the future and what needs to be done now, said Henderson, who arrived from Sunderland in a \u00a316million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager. Jordan Henderson, in action against Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday, has agreed a new Liverpool deal . Henderson has enjoyed a strong campaign and could be handed the armband when Steven Gerrard leaves . Asked if there was ever a point when he thought negotiations might not reach a successful conclusion, Henderson replied: \u2018Not really, no. For me it was just a case of leaving it to the club and my agent to sort it out. \u2018I always said that I wanted to stay at Liverpool and there was no other club that I would go to. I wanted to commit my future and it was just a matter of time for my agent and the club to sort it out. Thankfully today it\u2019s done.' Henderson is keen to add to his trophy cabinet after winning just one trophy since sealing a move to Liverpool in 2011. 'Hopefully we've got many years ahead of winning trophies,' Henderson told liverpoolfc.com. 'I'm the same as every other player, I want to be playing at the highest level - in the Champions League, winning trophies and being very successful. 'I had good conversations with the manager about the future of the football club and it was very bright, I was very pleased with what I was hearing. 'I want to be a big part of that and hopefully I can. 'I feel there's a lot of potential, but we need to start turning that potential into winning things. I've got a good feeling that we can do that.' Henderson\u00a0arrived from Sunderland in a \u00a316million deal in June 2011, when Kenny Dalglish was manager . The Liverpool midfielder shoots during Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa . Rodgers added: 'Jordan is a brilliant professional and his dedication to his career and football in general makes him a role model to all young players. 'He has faced adversity in his time at Liverpool, but his improvement, growth and development is entirely down to his own hunger, commitment and willingness to learn and be better. 'The fact he has made such a long-term commitment to Liverpool is a sign of his belief in what we are looking to do here. He will have a crucial role to play as we look to take this side forward and look to add success to the progress we have made. 'I am very excited about our future and what this group can achieve together; today's announcement is another important positive step forward.'",

Abdul Hadi Arwani was found slumped in the back seat of his black Volkswagen Passat on Tuesday morning in Wembley, north west London. The 48-year-old Syrian national was an outspoken critic of the Assad regime and 'actively' campaigned against extremist, his family have since revealed. On Monday morning Scotland Yard confirmed that a 46-year-old had been arrested in  Brent, north west London, on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. A 46-year-old man has been arrested in connection with Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured above) who was found dead on Tuesday . Police are appealing to anyone who may have seen Mr Arwani or his car in Wembley on either Sunday April 5 or Tuesday April 7 . He is being questioned at a central London police station while officers continue their appeal for witnesses. A Scotland Yard spokesman said authorities remained 'open minded' about the culprit's motive for killing the father-of-six who has been described as 'the most peaceful man you could wish to meet'. They would not comment on claims that a hitman had lured the preacher to the area on false pretences before shooting him repeatedly while sat in the back seat of his car. They want to speak to anyone who may have seen Mr Arwani or his car, a dark coloured Volkswagen Passat. It is understood that Mr Arwani visited the area where his body was found two days beforehand on Sunday 5, parking in the Havenwood area for 'a short while'. A post-mortem examination revealed he had died as a result of gun wounds. Counter-terrorism investigators were drafted by Metropolitan Police last week 'because 'of their expertise in the management of investigations with international dimensions and an established liaison network abroad'. They refused to reveal whether either Mr Arwani's passionate view of Syria or his connection to the An-Noor Mosque in Acton was being considered as a line of inquiry.

Lisa Colagrossi had just finished covering a house fire in the borough of Queens on March 19, when the married mother-of-two collapsed from a brain aneurysm and never regained consciousness. The reporter's mother Lois Colagrossi was greeting mourners at her funeral on March 23 when she was approached by her daughter's boss Camille Edwards. Witnesses who overheard the allegedly awkward interaction told the New York Post's Page Six that Mrs Colagrossi refused to hug Edwards and told her: 'You are the reason I am standing in this church'. Scroll down for video . Blame game: The mother of WABC reporter Lisa Colagrossi (left) has allegedly blamed her sudden death by a brain aneurysm to being overworked by boss Camille Edwards (right) Edwards went on to tell Mrs Colagrossi how hard of a worker her daughter was and how everyone at the station respected her. 'I am talking about how you worked my daughter to death,' Mrs Colagrossi responded. Sources told the newspaper that Edwards was then shuffled away. The paper reports that Edwards is feared at the station, where she has been nicknamed 'Camevil'. 'Camille is a bully and will target people she doesn't like, most often women. Lisa's colleagues applaud Lisa's mom for standing up to Camille,' a source told Page Six . Lisa Colagrossi, who lived with her husband and two sons in Stamford, Connecticut, would commute into the city each day as early as 2am and work through the afternoon. Unexpected: Colagrossi (center) was returning from covering a house fire in Queens, New York on March 19 when the married mother-of-two collapsed from a brain aneurysm and never regained consciousness . However, the family has denied any grudge against either Edwards or the station where Colagrossi worked. 'We are extremely thankful and blessed by all the support from Camille and the entire ABC family. Lisa always chose to work the overnight shift because it allowed her to spend the most time with her family,' the family said in a statement. In a separate statement, WABC said: 'Camille is a tireless and compassionate champion for everyone who works here. Under her watch, we\u2019re fortunate to have more women in leadership positions than ever before. Our thoughts and prayers are with Lisa\u2019s family at this sad time.' Colagrossi started at the station in 2001, on the Sunday following the 9/11 attacks, and covered such high-profile stories as the Sandy Hook massacre. Colagrossi is a native of Ohio and had previously worked at stations in Alabama and West Virginia.

There's something effortless about a wide leg trouser that really appeals. And if like us you are growing tired of the skinny jean and want to try out a new look this could be your answer. Louise Redknapp says that a wide-leg trouser can come as a welcome relief from the skinny jean . Skinny jeans have held court for quite a few years now and while they will never go out of style the wide leg will give you an alternative look. It's not the first time this look has made a comeback since the Seventies. Lou tried the out the trend seven years ago with a Stella McCartney flared jean - luckily she kept hold of them! The wide leg can be intimidating, especially if you're on the shorter side. But the key is all in the shoe. Huge amounts of fabric is hard to look flattering but if you keep your heels high and your top half simple you can pull it off with confidence. A high heeled shoe with an exposed top of foot will elongate the leg, a must when wearing a cropped voluminous trouser. Louise and Emma say to avoid being drowned by too much fabric try a high heeled shoe . Louise recommends pairing a wide-leg with a simple knit to keep the outfit in proportion . If going for a longer length go high-waisted and very long to give extra leg length. Proportion is everything, team with a simple knit, shirt or tee to keep the look current and cool, not costume. Denim is the easiest way to nail the trend - Gucci revisited the Seventies with a collection filled with flared jeans in vintage washes. The stylish pair agree that denim is the easiest way to achieve the trend . The wide-leg trouser made an appearance on several catwalks including on the runway of Gucci SS15 who showcased a denim take on the trend, for a high street take try the Topshop Miller jean (right) Celine showcased colourful billowing bottoms on their SS15 runway . Topshop meanwhile have been quick to follow suit with their version - the Miller - a 1970s-style wide leg flare. Celine and Stella McCartney kept it classy with a dressier-style pant, perfect for an evening look. Try new online label Finery London for a similar style with a lower price tag.

    "source": "Scientists claim the computer keyboard could be a powerful new tool in their battle against Parkinson's disease. Researchers in Massachusetts believe a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills. Now they're working on creating a keyboard that can tell doctors if someone has the neuron impairment, simply by analysing the way they type. Scroll down for video . Scientists claim the common computer keyboard could be a powerful new tool in their battle against Parkinson's disease. Researchers in Massachusetts say a person's keystrokes may reveal a huge amount of information about their motor skills . For the body to begin moving, the brain's primary motor cortex sends signals through several other brain regions, including the supplementary motor area, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. These brain areas activate spinal neurons that stimulate muscles to execute the movement. But many factors can interfere with motor ability, including sleep deprivation, which reduces dexterity. In people with Parkinson's disease, dopamine-producing cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra are killed off, leading to tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulty walking . Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have now created an algorithm that can tell how effectively someone is striking a keypad. For instance, it can distinguish between typing done in the middle of the night, when sleep deprivation impairs motor skills, and typing performed when fully rested. It does this by analysing something known as 'key hold time' - a measure of how long a key is pressed before being released. The study is based on the premise that 'there might be hidden information in the way that we type,' says Ian Butterworth, one of researchers. 'At the moment, pretty much all of the other information in typing is thrown out. We just pay attention to what keys are being pressed, not when or for how long.' Scientists have developed a six-minute test which could give an early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Currently Parkinson's patients only discover they have the debilitating neurological problem when the symptoms have already taken hold. But last year Oxford University academics have come up with a new way of spotting the disease at an early stage. The researchers were able to detect early Parkinson's disease with a remarkable 85 per cent accuracy. The technique uses an MRI scanner to monitor the neural connections in a concentrated area at the very centre of the brain. Even at a very early stage, Parkinson's patients had much weaker connections in the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is associated with motor control. The study, which has been published in the journal Neurology, found that by taking 180 pictures in six minutes they could spot the poor connections. They also found that the test had a very low chance of incorrectly diagnosing healthy people with the disease. This study focused on the effects of fatigue, but the researchers say they could diagnose conditions that impair motor function, such as Parkinson's disease, much earlier than is now possible. Preliminary results from a study of about two dozen Parkinson's patients suggest that the researchers' algorithm for analysing keystrokes can also distinguish people who have the disease from those who don't. The team is now planning a larger study of Parkinson's patients. They are also working on smartphone apps that could be used to gather the same kind of data from mobile devices. 'We thought this was a unique opportunity to have a window into the brain using your normal interactions with an electronic device,' says MIT researcher Alvaro Sanchez-Ferro. 'You already have the hardware. You just have to let someone evaluate the information you collect every day when you use the device, and try to pull it out for health-related purposes.' People are usually diagnosed with Parkinson's disease five to 10 years after the beginning of the disease, and lot of the damage has already been done, the researchers say. John Growdon, director of the Memory and Movement Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, says it will be important for the researchers to demonstrate in future studies that the typing deficiencies correlate with the severity of Parkinson's disease. 'Overall, it strikes me that this has great potential to detect subtle motor impairments even in advance of a clinician's ability to find them,' adds Growdon, who was not involved in the study. The researchers believe this strategy could also be used to evaluate patients with other diseases that affect motor skills, such as rheumatoid arthritis. 'This might have applications in any disease producing a motor impairment, whether it's in your hands and muscles or the brain,' Sanchez-Ferro says. The team are working on smartphone apps that may be used to gather the same type of data from mobiles .",

Mrs Clinton said that she wanted nobody to know when she was going to the pool apart from one usher who was to guide her there. There she would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking \u2018heartbroken\u2019, according to a new book. A new book has claimed that Hillary Clinton imposed a blanket of secrecy on her movements during the Monica Lewinsky scandal . The vivid account is written by Kate Andersen Brower, a former White House correspondent for Bloomberg News in \u2018The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House.\u2019 She tells how in the summer of 1998, a few days before Mr Clinton would admit to sex with former White House intern Miss Lewinsky, usher Worthington White was approached by Mrs Clinton. She told him that she wanted to go to the pool but that only he could see her - no other aides and no Secret Service. Mr White said that he told Mrs Clinton\u2019s lead Secret Service agent: \u2018If anybody sees her, or she sees anybody, I\u2019m going to get fired, I know it. And you probably will too\u2019. By the pool Mrs Clinton would spend three and a half hours sitting on her own reading looking \u2018heartbroken, it is claimed . Mrs Clinton\u2019s wish was granted and she took an elevator to the pool, spent the afternoon there and came back the same way, . Miss Brower writes that Mrs Clinton \u2018turned to White, took his hands and squeezed them, looked him in the eye, and thanked him.\u2019 The book also recounts how the Clintons did not trust the old fashioned White House telephone system and felt too many people could listen in - so had it completely rewired . Miss Brower writes: \u2018They had all the White House phones changed over to interior circuitry so that if the first lady was in the bedroom and the president was in the study, she could ring him from room to room without going through the operator\u2019. Such upheaval did not go down well with staff and according to James W.F. \u2018Skip\u2019 Allen, an usher from 1979 to 2004, the Clintons were \u2018about the most paranoid people I\u2019d ever seen in my life\u2019. The disclosure sheds new light on the row over Mrs Clinton\u2019s use of a private email account and her own personal server whilst Secretary of State. It could harm her chances in the race for the Presidency in 2016 - she is expected to announce her candidacy this month. A new poll has found that Mrs Clinton\u2019s approval ratings have slipped since the scandal broke and she is two points behind former Florida governor Jeb Bush, her likely opponent.

He recently revealed in an interview how he feels his mental strength helped him cope through the rough patch. Speaking about his exile from the first-team early in the campaign, he told FourFourTwo: 'I was positive. Every goalkeeper goes through those stages, and you only get mentally stronger from them. Because we play so many games, I just looked forward to the next match. Mignolet has recovered from an early season dip in form to play a key role in Liverpool's rise up the table . 'I always wanted to keep improving and moving forward. I'm in my second year now at Liverpool and I've learned a lot. 'There's always something to work on. I've just turned 27 but I still pick up things every day. That helps get through difficult moments.'

    "source": "Curiosity Rover has discovered strange, multi-coloured veins on Mars that could give astronomers new insights into the red planet's watery past. The mineral veins were found at a site called 'Garden City' on the slopes of Mount Sharp and stick up from the rock by up to 6cm (2.5 inches). Scientists believe the bizarre network of ridges formed in Mars' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded, much softer bedrock. This March 18, \u00a0view from the Mast Camera on the Curiosity rover shows a network of two-tone mineral veins. Scientists believe the bizarre formed in Mars' wet past billions of years ago above the now eroded bedrock . The ridges contain both bright and dark material. While Curiosity has found brightly coloured veins before, the darker ones remain have stumped scientists. 'Some of them look like ice-cream sandwiches: dark on both edges and white in the middle,' said Linda Kah, a Curiosity science-team member at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 'These materials tell us about secondary fluids that were transported through the region after the host rock formed.' Veins such as these form where fluids move through cracked rock and leave minerals in the fractures, often affecting the chemistry of the rock surrounding the fractures. This view from the Mars Hand Lens Imager on the arm of Curiosity rover is a close-up of a two-tone mineral vein at a site called 'Garden City' on lower Mount Sharp. It was taken during night, illuminated by LEDs . Kah said, 'At least two secondary fluids have left evidence here. 'We want to understand the chemistry of the different fluids that were here and the sequence of events. How have later fluids affected the host rock?' Some of the sequence is known: Mud that formed lake-bed mudstones must have dried and hardened before the fractures formed. The dark material that lines the fracture walls reflects an earlier episode of fluid flow than the white, calcium-sulphate-rich veins do - although both flows occurred after the cracks formed. In total, what is now the planet's arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles (20 million cubic km) of water . Thanks to missions like Nasa's Curiosity rover, we know Mars once had water - but until now we didn't know how much. Scientists have provided the best estimates yet, claiming it once had more water than the Arctic Ocean - and the planet kept these oceans for more than 1.5 billion years. The findings suggest there was ample time and water for life on Mars to thrive, but over the last 3.7 billion years the red planet has lost 87 per cent of its water - leaving it barren and dry. The study by scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the first to determine just how much water Mars had in its past. During its wet Noachian period - 4.1 to 3.7 billion years ago - it is estimated that it had enough water to cover the entire surface in a liquid layer 450 feet (137 metres) deep. However, it's likely that most of the water formed an ocean that occupied the northern hemisphere of Mars, which would have been as deep as one mile (1.6km) in places - comparable to the Mediterranean Sea on Earth. The research estimates that, in total, what is now the planet's arid northern plains would have contained at least 12.4 million cubic miles (20 million cubic kilometres) of water. Curiosity has been studying rocky areas since landing on the Martian surface in 2012. Garden City is about 39 feet (12 meters) higher than the bottom edge of the 'Pahrump Hills' outcrop of the bedrock forming the basal layer of Mount Sharp, at the center of Mars' Gale Crater. 'We investigated Pahrump Hills the way a field geologist would, looking over the whole outcrop first to choose the best samples to collect, and it paid off,' said David Blake of Nasa's Ames Research Center. Analysis is still in its early stages, but the three drilled samples from Pahrump Hills have clear differences in mineral ingredients. It seems that the two-toned minerals were created from two distinctive wet periods on the planet. Curiosity is now exploring different layers of Mount Sharp in the hope of finding more clues to the red planet's history.",

Many were sacked, stripped of their savings and even jailed after cash shortfalls were recorded at some branches \u2013 despite claims that a faulty IT system was to blame. The Post Office asked forensic accountants Second Sight to investigate the Horizon IT system in 2012, following complaints from dozens of subpostmasters who said they had been wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting when cash shortfalls were discovered. The Post Office failed to properly investigate why money had gone missing from branches before launching court proceedings against subpostmasters, a report has revealed (file picture) Now a leaked copy of the accountants\u2019 independent report has suggested that the discrepancies could have been caused by computer failures, cyber criminals or human error. It also accused the Post Office of failing \u2018in many cases\u2019 to identify \u2018the root cause of shortfalls\u2019 before starting civil or criminal proceedings. The review said some criminal cases brought by the Post Office were \u2018motivated primarily\u2019 by a desire to recover the money and did not appear to be supported by sufficient evidence. It went on to claim that the Post Office had failed to provide the accountancy firm with the documentation they required, and had \u2018terminated\u2019 their contract before they finished their research. The report has sparked fresh calls for a full independent inquiry into the computer system used by postmasters after the report reported concerns that \u2018in some circumstances Horizon can be systemically flawed\u2019. Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot said some subpostmasters had been 'dragged through the mud' Former Conservative MP James Arbuthnot, who led an MPs\u2019 campaign to support the subpostmasters, said: \u2018These people have been pillars of the community who had their reputations dragged through the mud \u2013 some have been sent to prison, they\u2019ve been made bankrupt, they\u2019ve had contracts terminated, I understand at least one has committed suicide. And the way they have been treated is an utter disgrace. I think there needs to be an independent inquiry.\u2019 Responding to the report, the Post Office said the review had repeated \u2018complaints made by a very small number of former postmasters, as well as a number of assertions and opinions\u2019 \u2013 but had not offered any new evidence to support the claims. They pointed out that they have received 150 complaints about the IT system since it opened a complaints system two years ago, a number they said represents a \u2018tiny fraction\u2019 of the 500,000 people who had used the system \u2018effectively\u2019. A spokesman said: \u2018In none of Post Office\u2019s own work, nor through any of Second Sight\u2019s work, has any information emerged to suggest that a conviction is unsafe.\u2019 But Andy Furey, of the Communication Workers Union, said: \u2018This is another damning report which reiterates the serious concerns of many postmasters. Part of the problem throughout has been the bullish behaviour of the Post Office towards postmasters who feel that they are helpless victims of a computer system gone wrong.\u2019 Sacked: Subpostmaster Michael Rudkin, 57 . A subpostmaster was pursued to the brink of ruin and his wife left contemplating suicide after being prosecuted by the Post Office. Michael Rudkin, 57, believes action was taken against him after he allegedly discovered that data in branches could be altered remotely \u2013 potentially explaining mystery cash shortfalls. The day after Mr Rudkin expressed concern at the revelation, a Post Office auditor turned up at his shop in Ibstock, Leicestershire, to tell him \u00a344,000 was unaccounted for. \u2018My world was turned upside down,\u2019 he said, adding: \u2018I became like a drowning man with no life raft.\u2019 Despite insisting he never saw a penny of the \u2018missing\u2019 funds, Mr Rudkin was forced to repay the money and his wife Susan, 60, who did most of the day-to-day running of the branch, was prosecuted and given a suspended prison sentence. Mr Rudkin had his contract terminated while his wife was left \u2018contemplating suicide\u2019 after her conviction.",

    "source": "(Billboard)The key to rock's longevity is it never defines itself into irrelevance. So while there were some loud, dirty guitars at the 2015 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland on Saturday night, there was as much recognition for rock's antecedents in soul and blues, speaking less to a particular taxonomy than a spirit that's beyond words. It's easy to talk of such spirit when Paul McCartney is there to honor Ringo Starr, and Yoko Ono is on hand as well. Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, \"just sad John and George aren't here,\" referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison. Starr was certainly happy to be there \u2014 after a long wait, he's the final Beatle to be inducted as a solo act. \"I've finally been invited, and I love it,\" said the 74-year-old drummer. \"I got lucky, and it was actually in Cleveland,\" he said to enormous applause. Fifty-one years earlier, Starr had been in town to play the very same Hall; he admitted backstage that he didn't remember the cops stopping the show during \"All My Loving\" and making the Beatles return to the dressing room for ten minutes until the fans could be calmed. Starr said in a backstage interview that he couldn't recall the incident specifically, but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between. \"I'll remember this one,\" he promised. Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan. It was a night for the young to honor the old and perhaps prepare for a later visit. John Mayer hailed his longtime idol, the late Vaughan, in a heartfelt speech. John Legend came out to honor Bill Withers with a performance of \"Use Me\" backed by Stevie Wonder, who inducted Withers. The two then shared \"Lean on Me,\" until Legend went and pulled Withers to the front of the stage to join them. Beck, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Bill Withers, Seymour Stein hit Rock Hall's weekend festivities . The 76-year old soul legend hasn't performed live in many years but had hinted in the months leading up to the induction ceremonies that he might sing once more. Withers sounded great, though he may have an even brighter future in stand-up. \"This has got to be the biggest AA meeting [in the] Western hemisphere,\" said Withers, alluding to an earlier moment in the show when Jimmie Vaughan confessed, \"I taught my brother guitar, and he taught me how to get sober.\" He called being inducted by Wonder, \"A lion holding the door for a kitty cat.\" The moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late Lou Reed by Patti Smith and Reed's widow, music artist Laurie Anderson, who shared the three rules for life that they came up with: \"One: don't be afraid of anyone; Two: get a really good b------t detector and learn how to use it; Three: be really, really tender.\" Smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions. She recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and Reed invited her up. She found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him. Green Day was inducted by Fall Out Boy, who referenced the length of some of the speeches. Cracked Fall Out Boy frontman Patrick Stump: \"I feel like I'm in a line at the DMV.\" As one of the youngest acts, it's not surprising they gave one of the two most exciting performances of the evening. Rock Hall induction ceremony: Lou Reed 'would be amused,' says sister . The other belonged to Tom Morello, Doyle Bramhall II and Zac Brown with harmonica player Jason Ricci performing \"Born in Chicago\" in tribute to the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Not only did Ricci slay, but Morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm, it was so alive. Miley Cyrus inducted Joan Jett in her own inimitable way, recalling a time she walked in on Jett smoking pot and being so turned on by her strength, wisdom and soul that the young pop star wanted to have sex with the legendary rocker. Jett joined the Blackhearts and Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl for a mini-set that include such classics as \"Bad Reputation,\" the Runaways' \"Cherry Bomb\" and \"Crimson and Clover,\" the Tommy James & the Shondelles cover that Jett took to No. 1. It was that kind of a night, and it closed with a rousing version of the Beatles' \"I Want to Be Your Man,\" where just about everybody who could make it out on stage did, including a near-end guitar scrum/lead-off between Gary Clark Jr., Morello, Zac Brown and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner. \u00a92015 Billboard.

Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor, who claims to be fighting with Islamic State in Syria, posted a video on YouTube in an attempt to incite violent acts in Australia and New Zealand during services commemorating Anzac Day's centenary. In the video, which has since been removed after 3 News\u00a0notified authorities, Taylor instructed fellow jihadists to act out against police and soldiers. 'Now is the time to commence your operations, even if it means you have to stab a few police officers, soldiers on Anzac Day and so be it.' Scroll down for video . Kiwi jihadi Mark John Taylor has posted a video to Youtube urging IS sympathisers to attack Anzac Day services in Australia and New Zealand . New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush confirmed Taylor was 'known to New Zealand authorities' and that this was not his first attempt at publicly 'airing his views'. Mr Bush said police had conducted a thorough assessment of the troubling video and he was satisfied all appropriate measures had been put into place to protect those who plan on attending Anzac Day services. 'We take our responsibility for the safety and security of New Zealanders very seriously and, while we are unable to go into detail, we have already taken further security measures.' Police in New Zealand have confirmed they have implemented extra security measures amid growing concerns of a targeted terror attack . 'Zealanders should feel confident in attending Anzac Day events as planned, while exercising their usual vigilance in light of the current global security environment,' Mr Bush said. Prime Minister John Key told 3 News the troubling video only further confirms that IS are a growing threat to New Zealand and its people. 'It just reaffirms what I've been saying, that IS is a war that they are trying to bring to New Zealand.' Mr Key told reporters that while IS enjoy 'inciting fear' by publicising the atrocities they commit, the group are under extreme scrutiny. 'Those people are under\u2026a pretty significant watch from the authorities, so we will continue to watch those people very, very closely.'

He reportedly burned his passport upon crossing the Syrian boarder and posted to Facebook that his move to Syria was a 'one-way trip, no going back', the Guardian reported. Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location in Syria to the whole world. While some claimed he did this unknowingly branding him the 'bumbling jihadi', Taylor said he had 'every intention' to display his location.

Before his account was suspended, Taylor became an active twitter user and made headlines after he geo-tagged 45 tweets, subsequently revealing his precise location to the world . This comes only weeks after an Anzac Day terror plot was foiled by Australian authorities when 200 officers raided properties in south east Melbourne. Five men were arrested and it was revealed they were allegedly plotting to run over a police officer, savage him with a knife and steal his gun so they could embark on a shooting rampage in the streets of Melbourne on Anzac Day. Two of the five men arrested in the pre-dawn raids remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court . A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, was being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. A British teenager was also arrested on suspicion of helping to plot the ISIS-inspired attack during Anzac Day commemorations. A 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire, allegedly communicated with Australian men who had planned to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. Police said the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after they intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested  on suspicion that he was instigating a beheading, again on Australian soil. The Australian Federal Police confirmed the 14-year-old's arrest was linked to counter terrorism operations in Australia. Five men were arrested in anti-terror raids in Melbourne, after the culmination of a month-long operation code-named Operation Rising .",

An FBI agent's sniper rifle was  ripped out of his car's window and stolen from a Salt Lake City hotel parking lot just days before President Obama visited Utah earlier this month. The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites, according to police. Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window, tying a rope around the rifle case's handle or a cable lock, and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case's handle free from the lock. The window frame of the agent's car was pulled from the door, which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window. 'The rifle had been secured properly,' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure. Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon.' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag, backpack, and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft, which the police report states happened overnight. The theft happened just a week before Obama (pictured during his visit) made a scheduled trip to Utah earlier this month . Officers found two skid marks and pieces of rope lying on the pavement near the car, as well as the broken-off handle of the rifle case. The agent's bags and some of his clothing were found at a Residence Inn across the street, but the sniper rifle has not been recovered. Marriott Springhill Suites, the agent's hotel, is next to the city's airport and just down the street from the state's FBI office. The hotel does not have surveillance cameras, according to the police report. Salt Lake City police said the rifle's serial number has been entered into the National Crime Information Computer. The Secret Service told Fox 13 Salt Lake City the agency was notified about the stolen rifle before President Obama's visit, but could not comment if the theft prompted an increase of security. Det. McGowan said police do not know if the thief specifically targeted the agent's car.

The Reds have slipped to seven points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City as a result of successive defeats by Manchester United and Arsenal, although things could have been worse had the champions managed to emerge from Monday night's trip to Crystal Palace with something to show for their efforts. Brendan Rodgers' men ended their mini-slump on Wednesday evening with a 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay victory at Blackburn, and Carver knows they will will determined to add three points to that to keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish when the Magpies head for Anfield on Monday evening. John Carver says his players need to relieve the pressure of their shoulders with a win against Liverpool . He said: 'They are only seven points off it, I think, and they'll think they have still got a chance, seven points off it with seven games to go. 'I remember our football club having a huge gap for (to win) the championship and it dwindling away, so anything is possible. 'They'll think they've still got a chance of getting into that top four, and I'll be very surprised if the manager doesn't prepare his team thinking like that, so we know we are going to have a difficult game. Brendan Rodgers and his side have slipped out of the top four and out of Champions League contention . 'But there's a bit of pressure on ourselves as well.' That pressure comes specifically because of Sunday's 1-0 derby defeat at Sunderland, the Magpies' fifth successive reverse in the fixture, but more generally as a result of a run of 13 games in all competition under their current head coach which has brought just two victories. Newcastle have not added to their points tally of 35 since they beat Aston Villa on February 28, some four games ago, and have scored just once in the process. The Newcastle boss looks increasingly unlikely to get the job, with his results failing to impress . They remain nine points clear of the relegation zone, but with European challengers Tottenham heading for St James' Park next weekend, the situation could get worse before it gets better. Carver's cause has not been helped by an injury and suspension list which at some points has robbed him of an entire XI, and while there is light at the end of the tunnel for midfielders Rolando Aarons and Siem de Jong, the trip to Merseyside will come too soon. Carver said: 'I would say Rolando is certainly ahead of Siem de Jong at the moment, but neither of those guys will be available this weekend.' Rolando Aarons (left) and Siem de Jong are back in training but won't be available for Monday night .",

The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain. He said the two parties were pretending to 'slug it out' ahead of next month's poll \u2013 but insisted they were both working to ramp up spending regardless of the deficit. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain . Mr Cameron said Ed Miliband could now only become Prime Minister with the support of the SNP. He told activists: 'We meet here in Scotland in the middle of a massive political fight. We've got Labour and the SNP on opposite sides \u2013 slugging it out \u2013 but if you take a step back they're really on the same side. 'You have a weak Labour party, who want more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. And the people who will prop them up, the SNP \u2013 who want even more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.' Mr Cameron said together, the SNP and Labour 'pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom', adding: 'A coalition of chaos.' He said: The SNP acting as the chain to Labour's wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery - and it will be you who pays the price. With jobs losses, massive tax rises and an economy back on brink of bankruptcy.' Mr Cameron's blistering attack comes ahead of tonight's live TV election debates between the main 'challenger' parties - including Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon, alongside the leaders of Ukip, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Mr Cameron walks with the leader of Scottish Conservatives as they launch the Tories' election manifesto today . David Cameron and Nick Clegg are not taking part because they have been in power for the last five years. Mr Miliband is expected to use the BBC debate to issue a warning to Scottish voters that success for the SNP north of the border could deliver a Conservative government in Westminster. The Labour leader has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP in a hung Parliament, but he is likely to face calls from Ms Sturgeon to join a 'progressive alliance' to bring an immediate end to austerity, which is also backed by Plaid and the Greens. Nicola Sturgeon has called on Ed Miliband to work with the SNP to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 . Conservatives are hoping that the debate would give added bite to their claim that a Miliband administration would be 'in the pocket' of the SNP. Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Will we see the alternative to David Cameron in the Challengers Debate? A Frankenstein coalition to bankrupt and break up Britain.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate.",

The technology is based on a technique known as 'neuromodulation' in which electricity from a chip stimulates the nervous system to restore sight. The revolutionary system is being commercialised by French company Pixium Vision, with clinical trials scheduled for 2016. Scroll down for video . Goggles that could help the blind see have come a step closer to reality. The technology is based on a technique known as 'neuromodulation' in which electricity stimulates the nervous system to restore sight. A surgeon first implants a small silicon chip with 150 electrodes on the retina. When the patient puts on the system's dark glasses, an integrated video camera sends images to a portable computer. A connected 'pocket processor' converts that recording into an infrared image, which the goggles will then beam into the eye. Pulses activate electrodes in the implant, and the optic nerve carries images to the brain. Retinal implants that restore some sight when in the blind are already available, but their quality isn't good enough to work in many real-world conditions. Pixium Vision's solution, however, claims it has been able to restore the sight of rats to a level equivalent to 20/250. This would allow the wearer to see the largest line of letters in an opticians test. The company claims it may be able to get its final product to restore vision to 20/120, which would be a huge leap forward in vision quality. Second Sight, the company that got FDA approval for the first visual prosthesis two years ago, currently offers patients about 20/1300 vision.

The latest huge land mass is 1.5 square miles (four square kilometres) in size and was created by dumping sand on\u00a0live coral reefs, possibly damaging local ecosystems. But this is just one of several artificial islands China has been creating in the region - and the exact purpose of them is unknown. China is creating a 'great wall of sand' in the South China Sea, the US Navy has claimed. Five islands have already been made, with two more in development. This image shows the Johnson Reef on 25 February 2014, which has seen land added drastically over the last three years. A Chinese vessel is seen at the top . The large expanses of sand and concrete - the latest being Johnson Reef - are being built among the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dumping it on subermeged coral reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China -\u00a0explained. And experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. Five islands in total have been built in this way, and two more are in development. Richard Dodge of the Nova Southeastern University Oceanographic Center, said: 'The activities described would appear to clearly both be greatly exceeding corals and coral reefs\u2019 ability to cope and survive the excess sediments and turbidity.' He said that as the reefs were being covered by cement and landfill, this constituted 'outright destruction' of the buried coral reefs and associated habitats. 'Coral reefs are extremely globally and locally valuable both for the biodiversity and ecosystem they create but also for the tremendous services they provide in terms of food supply, cultural heritage, erosion prevention, recreation, tourism, and habitat for myriad other organisms,' he continued. 'Coral reefs worldwide are under extreme threat from changing climate and from local sources of land based pollution, over fishing, and coastal construction. 'The activities described would appear to represent an additional and severe threat to coral reef ecosystem health and sustainability.' Robert Nicholls, a\u00a0Professor of Coastal Engineering at the University of Southampton, added: 'It is clearly destroying [coral reefs] at the local scale of the land claim and the environment. 'In the bigger scheme of things it is harder to be precise as these are small areas in a large area of reef.' Experts have told MailOnline that the activities could be hugely damaging to local ecosystems. China has supposedly been carrying out the land reclamation in order to build airstrips and other structures in the region. The extent of how much damage is being done is seen in this image . This photo released by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like on 28 February 2013. A Chinese-made structure stands on the Johnson Reef, called Mabini by the Philippines and Chigua by China, in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea . This photo, taken on 13 March 2012, shows what the Johnson Reef looked like before China started to build there. The Philippines has protested China's reclamation of land in the disputed reef in the South China Sea that can be used to build an airstrip or an offshore military base in the increasingly volatile region . Yesterday, the commander of the US Pacific Fleet - Admiral Harry Harris Jr - warned that the constructions were 'increasing regional tensions and the potential for miscalculation.' 'China is building artificial land by pumping sand on to live coral reefs - some of them submerged - and paving over them with concrete. China has now created over 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) of artificial landmass,' he said. Harris said the region is known for its beautiful natural islands, but 'in sharp contrast, China is creating a great wall of sand with dredges and bulldozers over the course of months.' China claims virtually all of the South China Sea, but the Philippines and other countries which have territorial disputes with China in the busy sea have been particularly concerned by the land reclamation projects. These have turned a number of previously submerged reefs in the Spratlys archipelago into artificial islands with buildings, runways and wharves. The islands could be used for military and other facilities to bolster China's territorial claims. The dispute centres around hundreds of tiny shoals, reefs and islets in the South China Sea known as the Spratlys and the Paracels. Several south Asian countries stake claim to the territory, though China tries to control the largest portion of the archipelago. Beijing has claimed its right to the collection of land masses is 2,000 years old which, they say, includes the islands in Chinese history. Taiwan supports its claim, and has its own airfield on the island of Taiping. Vietnamese officials say their government has ruled over the land since the 17th century whilst the Philippines, the closest geographically, says the islands belong to them. In 1974, Chinese forces seized the Paracels from Vietnam, killing 70 troops. There were further clashes between the two countries in 1988, with 60 Vietnamese soldiers killed. In 2012 China and the Philippines were embroiled in a lengthy maritime standoff over a Scarborough Shoal. The\u00a0Filipino military employed its largest warship for the dispute over the stretch of water which they call Panatag. Upon boarding a Chinese military vessel for inspection, officials claimed they found live sharks, clams and illegal reef. Later, Vietnamese border agencies refused to stamp passports asserting Chinese sovereignty over a handful of the islands and in January it was claimed China would be taken to a UN tribunal to challenge its stake. China is creating the area by using dredging vessels to dig up sediment from the sea, and then dump it on subermeged reefs to make islands, Ethan Rosen - a geopolitical researcher in China - explained. Shown is an image of a dredging vessel in San Francisco, demonstrating how land can be moved from underwater . Harris said the pace of China's construction of artificial islands 'raises serious questions about Chinese intentions.' He said the US continues to urge all claimants to conform to the 2002 China-ASEAN Declaration of Conduct, in which the parties committed to 'exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.' 'How China proceeds will be a key indicator of whether the region is heading toward confrontation or cooperation,' he said. The US says it has a national interest in the peaceful resolution of the disputes in a region crucial for world trade. China says its territorial claims have a historical basis and objects to what it considers US meddling.",

The Ukip leader said he would accept the result and rejected claims his party would become 'redundant' as a result. Mr Farage, appearing on a special Question Time-style programme filmed in Birmingham today, even claimed the party could enjoy an SNP-style surge in support in the wake of a vote to remain in the EU. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage, speaking tonight on a special Question Time style programme broadcast on the BBC, insisted he would not give up trying to pull Britain out of the European Union even if voters rejected leaving in a referendum . The Ukip leader said he would accept the result, but rejected claims his party would become 'redundant' as a result . The Ukip leader's comments come after David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced a live-TV grilling over their plans for the next five years in power. All three leaders faced questions over Mr Cameron's proposed European referendum in 2017. The Prime Minister revealed that he would not go into any future Coalition which refused to grant the public a say on Britain's membership of the EU. Mr Miliband however batted off criticism from the audience to insist that he would not hold a referendum \u2013 insisting it was not in Britain's interests. Speaking tonight, Mr Farage claimed Britain could thrive outside the EU and vowed to push for a referendum before 2017. He said: 'The point about a referendum is we've had a variety of promises of referendums that have never been delivered. 'I want that referendum conducted on full, free and fair terms. And what I mean by that is that both sides must have the same spending limits. The broadcasters must have an Ombudsman to make sure there is a proper, even debate and we must - and we must define who is qualified to vote in this referendum and who isn't. 'And if it's a full, free and fair referendum I will accept the result. Would it make UKIP redundant? No, because just look at what's happened in Scotland. The Scots \u2013 the Scots rejected their independence referendum and yet the SNP have gone to remarkable heights since then.' The Ukip leader faced questions from a live audience for the show, hosted by the presenter Jo Cockburn, broadcast tonight . The show was broadcast after David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg faced a live-TV grilling over their plans for the next five years in power . Mr Farage's claim that Ukip could surge to similar levels of support to the SNP is likely to spark accusations of hubris. In the wake of last year's independence referendum in Scotland, the SNP has seen its support surge to 54 per cent \u2013 putting it on course, according to some analysts, to win all 59 seats north of the border. Ukip meanwhile trail badly behind both the Tories and Labour \u2013 currently languishing on between 10-15 per cent in the polls. Unlike the SNP, the party is expected to win no more than five seats on May 7 \u2013 with some pollsters predicting only the popular Douglas Carswell clinging onto his seat in Clacton, Essex. But Mr Farage insisted Ukip was on course to do well at the election and claimed the party's stance on border controls was backed by the vast majority of the country. He said: '77 per cent of British people want us to have proper border controls and reduced immigration levels, all right? I am pro immigration, but I'm pro controlled immigration.' During the earlier TV showdown Mr Cameron guaranteed that he would not go into government with any party that would not give the public an in-out referendum . Ed Miliband, appearing on the Question Time special tonight, insisted he would not give voters a say on Europe . Mr Farage said Ukip could save 'easily \u00a31bn a year' from NHS health tourism and returned to the controversial topic of foreign HIV sufferers receiving treatment on the NHS. He said: 'The issue I specifically raised was the issue that since 2012 anybody can come to Britain, not to live, but anybody can come to Britain and get HIV treatment on the National Health Service. 'Now it's interesting. I have here a letter from a 30 year old HIV positive man in London who says, why are the waiting rooms now full to overflowing? Why does it now take me three weeks to get an appointment? 'And he says to me, it is because since we opened the door in 2012 we're now incapable of providing HIV treatment for people legally living in Britain.' Mr Farage, facing tough questions from the studio audience, insisted Britain would not be damaged by leaving the EU. He said: 'We're not exiting Europe. Let's be very clear about that. I love Europe, it's a wonderful place. It's got different countries, different people, different languages, cultures, wines, cheeses, it's a great place. 'And providing it's democratic and not fighting each other it is, I think in many ways the richest, culturally the richest continent on Earth. 'However, what now masquerades as being Europe, what has hijacked the word Europe, is something called the European Union which has a flag, it has an anthem, it has a President \u2013 not that anyone can ever name who they are \u2013 and it is a political union that now makes nearly 75% of our laws, costs us a great deal of money and I think is wholly unnecessary, not just for Britain, but I feel that for the rest of Europe too. Nicola Sturgeon faced questions  from a studio audience at BBC Scotland in Glasgow this evening . The Scottish First Minister insisted she would block a Labour budget if Mr Miliband would not compromise with her . The Ukip leader also backtracked on comments praising the Russian leader Vladimir Putin \u2013 admitting that he was 'probably' a threat to the UK. 'Mr Putin who is clearly acting aggressively. I think he is a threat to us. I think there is also a threat from some of the extreme Islamic elements in the Middle East and it's back to the question about defence.'",

This has been a remarkable season at St Mary's, with the club already having levelled the record Premier League points tally of 56 set last year. That record will no doubt be broken in the coming weeks and things could get better still, with Manchester City's sudden drop-off opening up the potential for a top-four finish. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes his side must win their last six games to finish inside top four . Saints remained in the hunt for a place in next season's Champions League by beating Hull at St Mary's . Southampton are five points behind Man City . Saints have five points to claw back on the reigning champions but Koeman believes it is possible if they win all their remaining games. 'Normally yes,' the Dutchman said. 'The distance is five points. We need to win I think all. 'They (City) don't lose three games, no. They have the next two at home. Normally, with the players that they have, the qualities. 'You never know, but it's all about to win the last six to have really a good chance to be one of the top four teams.' Saints travel to the Etihad Stadium on the final day of the season and, by contrast to the other sides chasing a top-four berth, have a kind set of fixtures before that. Tottenham and Aston Villa come to St Mary's, while trips to Sunderland, Leicester and City follow Saturday's match at Stoke. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle scored in his side's 2-0 Premier League win over Hull . Stoke vs Southampton - April 18 . Southampton vs Tottenham - April 25 . Sunderland vs Southampton - May 2 . Leicester vs Southampton - May 9 . Southampton vs Aston Villa - May 16 . Manchester City vs Southampton - May 24 . 'Yeah, but in the last part of the season, OK, what's the best to play against?' Koeman asked. 'A team who's fighting for no relegation or two teams who are fighting for the title? I don't know. 'Every game is difficult. You have to be on your level to win a game. All are difficult. 'We play Sunderland away, we play Leicester away and they're fighting for not going down and that's even difficult.' Koeman is certainly not taking the run-in lightly and the trip to the Britannia Stadium will be an interesting test for Southampton's players at this stage. 'It is a difficult one,' the Dutchman said. 'We have that experience this season two times we play Stoke, one time at home and one time away for the League Cup. 'Both games we won but in both it was difficult because we know the qualities of them. 'We know the manager was always with the high spirit, the high intention in the game, physical players, direct game. 'Maybe we are lucky to play this weekend there, with the temperature and weather but I know it's always windy and that makes it still more difficult. 'The weather will be good this weekend and circumstances good for the weekend.'",

A mother who was banned from her son's school after abusing staff then used one of the child's books to deliver a homophobic tirade to a teacher. Angela Linton wrote the vile message, directed at gay teacher Thomas O'Brien, after a row about a school outing, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. The 47-year-old, from Handsworth in Birmingham, has been given a community order, told to carry out unpaid work and fined \u00a3185 for harassing the victim. Linton's son started at Perry Beeches secondary school in September last year, the court heard. Helen Shipley, prosecuting, said that Linton approached head of year Mr O'Brien in October and expressed concern that she could not afford to send her son on a forthcoming residential trip. She was told that the school could come to an alternative arrangement, but failed to attend a scheduled meeting and then abused Mr O'Brien over the phone. Miss Shipley said: 'Linton felt that the school, in particular Mr O'Brien, was unfairly targeting her son, who had been placed in detention over having a mobile phone in class.' In another incident, Linton was shouting and acting aggressively outside the school entrance, and was told to leave the premises. School officials then sent the angry mother a letter telling her she was banned, and could only communicate with the school via the assistant headteacher or in her son's pass book. In January, she wrote a message in the book referring to the phone row she had with Mr O'Brien and abusing him for being gay. 'Mr O'Brien said he was traumatised by reading these comments,' Miss Shipley said. 'His sexuality was well known. He said it was something he was comfortable with. 'He could not believe they had been written. He did not know the reason for it.' School: The row began when Linton's son - a pupil at Perry Beeches, pictured - could not afford to go on an outing . Akhmed Yakoob, defending, said Linton felt remorse over her actions, which were out of character. Linton pleaded guilty to displaying writing which caused harassment, alarm or distress, and was sentenced to a 12-month community order. She was also ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and to pay \u00a3100 compensation to the victim and \u00a385 costs. Chairman of the bench Peter Pratt said: 'There is no doubt whatsoever that you have intentionally caused harassment, alarm or distress, most obviously to Mr O'Brien. 'The virulent language undoubtedly caused Mr O'Brien to be fearful.'",

Miss Schumacher's impressive performance at the horse show comes just days after her 16-year-old brother Mick returned to the racing circuit just weeks after he was involved in a 100mph crash - and once again ended up going off the track. He made his pre-season test debut in Formula 4 at the Oschersleben circuit in Germany - but at one point was pictured accidentally driving through gravel. Mick, whose father Michael won the Formula 1 championship seven times, reached the new category after seven years of karting in what is seen as a stepping stone for junior drivers hoping to reach the top. Michael Schumacher, 46, remains under the care of medics\u00a0at his home on Lake Geneva following his catastrophic ski accident in the Swiss Alps in 2013.

Trotting along: Miss Schumacher's put in an impressive performance at the horse show yesterday afternoon . Gina Maria Schumacher and boyfriend Riccardo are pictured at the NRHA European Futurity Horse Show . Michael Schumacher spent months in a coma following the accident before being transferred to a rehab clinic in Lausanne, Switzerland. He was then moved to a medical suite built into his mansion last September. Since being transferred to the medical suite built into his home, a news blackout has fallen over his condition, but insiders report he remains mute and unable to move. In February, it was revealed that Schumacher had sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home for \u00a32million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries. The sale of the retreat, in Trysil, north of Oslo, comes after it emerged last year that his family was planning to build a \u00a310million 'hospital' room for the star at their home in Switzerland. Road to recovery: Michael Schumacher (pictured with wife Corinna in 2004) was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France when the catastrophic accident happened in December 2013 . Liquidating his assets: Michael Schumacher's family has sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home (pictured) for \u00a32million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries . Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in December 2013. He was skiing with then 14-year-old Mick on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. Laughing: Gina Maria Schumacher's impressive performance at the horse shows comes after her 16-year-old brother Mick (left and right) returned to the racing circuit just weeks after being involved in a 100mph crash . Back in action: The protege was back on the circuit just weeks after a 100mph crash at the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany . The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. Since September last year he has been looked after by medical experts at his home in Gland, Switzerland.",

    "source": "David Crossley developed large kidney stones . Like many busy people, David Crossley often used to find himself so wrapped up in his working day that he would go without lunch, and often barely stopped for a cup of tea. In fact, David, 63, a musculoskeletal therapist from Birmingham, admits: 'I would often be so busy at the clinic that I'd forget to drink any liquid at all, other than the odd cup of tea or coffee. It had been the same way for years - although I would drink more water at weekends.' Last year, this habit caught up with him. He noticed a vague ache in his abdomen, stretching around to his back. 'It wasn't agonising but it just didn't feel quite right, so I went to the GP,' he says. 'As I had some bloating, he sent me for an ultrasound.' This revealed two large stones in his right kidney - a direct result, his doctors believe, of his low fluid intake. A CT scan showed that the stones were so large (6 mm across) they could not be passed naturally, and he needed surgery. One in ten of us will develop a kidney stone, and the numbers are rising dramatically. They are the result of waste products in the blood forming crystals inside the kidneys, which eventually build up into a solid lump. They can be excruciatingly painful - on a level, say experts, with childbirth. The stones often remain symptomless while they're in the kidney. They start causing pain - known as renal colic - once they travel down the ureter, the narrow tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder. 'Renal colic is caused by the stone suddenly blocking the ureter,' says Mr Leye Ajayi, consultant urological surgeon at the Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth, London. The pain often comes on suddenly and can cause the patient to 'writhe around in agony', he adds. The pain can be intense enough to cause nausea and vomiting. Once on the move, a stone can take days or weeks to travel out of the body. In that time, it may cause persistent or intermittent pain in the back, groin or side, a need to urinate more than usual, and pain when urinating. Sometimes, if a stone blocks the exit of urine from the kidney, it can lead to a build-up of bacteria and trigger a kidney infection. Signs of this include a fever, shivering, extreme weakness, diarrhoea, or cloudy and bad-smelling urine. The bad news is that the number of people developing troublesome stones is rocketing. Emergency admissions to hospital for kidney stones have shot up during the past decade by 136 per cent, according to official figures, rising from just above 5,000 to almost 12,000 per year. Meanwhile, the number of people going in for planned non-emergency treatment for stones has almost doubled in the same period, rising from 26,666 in 2004 to 51,340. The cause for his condition, doctors believe, was low fluid intake . And bizarrely, it may be that healthier lifestyles - doing tough workouts at the gym, and then not drinking enough, or shunning carbohydrates - are partly to blame, and may be why cases are going up, especially among women. 'More men than women used to suffer from kidney stones, with a ratio of about three to one,' says Mr Ajayi. 'But an increasing number of women now get them, and the ratio is evening up.' The main cause of kidney stones is dehydration. 'Your kidneys are your waste-disposal system,' explains Dr Kathryn Griffith, the Royal College of GPs' clinical champion for kidney care. 'They discard all the waste chemicals produced by your body, and they can do this efficiently if enough liquid is drunk to help flush them through. 'But if you become dehydrated, you overload the kidneys with urine that has a high concentration of stone-forming chemicals, and these begin to bind together to build stones.' To avoid this, you need to drink enough to ensure your urine is 'the colour of white wine', says Dr Griffith - around 1.2 litres a day. You need more during hot weather or after exercise. Changing diet trends are also pushing the figures up. 'There has been a trend, especially in people either wanting to lose weight or bulk up muscle, to eat low-carb, high-protein diets,' says Dr Griffith. 'The animal proteins found in meat and fish break down into a waste chemical called uric acid (a known stone-former) in your urine. They also reduce the amount of citrate (a stone-inhibitor). 'This can lead to uric acid stones forming, especially if you also don't drink enough fluid to assist the kidneys in their disposal job.' There are other causes, too. Your kidneys remove sodium, which is the main component of salt, from your body. When they do this, they excrete calcium, too. But low-carb diets could also put you at risk . So the more salt you eat, the more calcium you will have in your urine, which can build into stones. Obesity is another risk factor. 'Obese people are more likely to have insulin resistance (where the body can't use insulin effectively),' says Mr Ajayi. This causes a change to the nature of urine, making it more acidic, which increases the risk of uric acid stones forming in the kidney. Eating excessive amounts of oxalate is another culprit, as it can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate stones - the most common kind. Oxalate-rich foods include tea, spinach, rhubarb, nuts, strawberries, beetroot and chocolate. They are all fine in moderation, but avoid large daily quantities. If you have more than two urinary tract infections within a short space of time, you should ask your GP for an ultrasound to rule out a less common kind of kidney stone called struvite stones, which are caused by a build-up of bacteria from repeated urinary tract infections, adds Dr Griffith. Virtually all stones under 5 mm in diameter can be passed naturally, with only prescription-strength pain relief and medication that relaxes the ureter needed while this happens, says Mr Ajayi. But if a stone is bigger, you may need to have treatment. The most common is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). This involves sending shock-waves of energy through the skin that break down the stone. 'This works for stones up to about 10 mm in diameter, but not for bigger ones, or for stones that are very hard,' says Mr Ajayi. 'It's also ineffective in most cases for people with obesity, as the shock-waves have further to go to reach the stone.' For bigger or harder stones, a ureteroscopy is performed. Under general anaesthetic, a thin scope is passed up your urethra and a laser is used to break up the stone. For very large stones (those over 15 mm), percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is used. A nephroscope - a telescope-like device - is inserted through a small incision in your back. The stone is broken up using a combination of high-frequency ultrasound and pneumatic energy (a bit like a pneumatic drill digging up a road). David Crossley had a ureteroscopy at the BMI Priory Hospital, Birmingham, in September. 'I was out the day after my surgery, and although there was some discomfort around my kidneys for a few days, thankfully I'm now stone-free.' He knows that a person who has had a stone has a 50 per cent chance of developing them again within five years unless they make changes to their lifestyle. 'The lifestyle changes that can be made to stop stones recurring are the same as those for avoiding them in the first place: proper hydration, low-salt, staying a healthy weight and reducing animal protein,' says Mr Ajayi. The British Association of Urological Surgeons advises that we should be aiming for no more than four of the following protein portions a day, two of which should be dairy to ensure you have enough calcium: 50-75 g of red meat, chicken or fish; two eggs; \u00bd pint of milk; 50g cheese; a small pot of yogurt. Mr Ajayi also recommends drinking water with lemon juice in it daily, as the citrate (a form of acetic acid) in lemons is a natural stone inhibitor that can prevent calcium from binding with other substances, such as oxalates, that lead to stones. Today, David ensures that he gets enough fluid. 'I didn't know that being too busy to drink enough could lead to kidney stones,' he says. 'I now drink water religiously!'",

During the investigation, detectives with the Metro Nashville Police Department in Tennessee also found that the agent, 33-year-old Daniel Boykin, entered the woman's home multiple times, where he took videos, photos and other data. Police found more than 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim on Boykin's phone and computer. The victim filed a complaint after seeing images of herself on his phone last year. Boykin plead guilty to unlawful photography, aggravated burglary and violation of the computer act, the Nashville District Attorney's Office said. Police said the incident happened in a TSA-only restroom, and that there was no evidence public restrooms were targeted. A TSA official tells CNN that Boykin worked in an administrative capacity and didn't engage in public security screening. Assistant District Attorney Amy Hunter said this case was one of the worst invasion of privacy cases she's seen. \"We are thankful that the sentence includes periodic confinement so that the sentence will hopefully make an impression on this defendant and others,\" Hunter said in a statement. The judge, Randall Wyatt, on Friday called the invasion of privacy \"egregious.\" His sentence also includes five and a half years of probation, which will include GPS monitoring. Boykin was terminated last year when the investigation began. \"TSA holds its employees to the highest ethical standards and has zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace,\" TSA's Ross Feinstein said in a statement.",

The reality TV star, who will be returning to Made In Chelsea in the coming weeks, is every inch the beach babe as she models the colourful clothes in the new shoot . The star, who can be seen showing off swimwear and tiny shorts, describes her perfect summer as 'sun, tan and chilling' Lucy models the Ibiza-inspired summer brights and tropical print sun dresses to perfection . Lucy, who, according to Heat magazine, is tipped to be making an appearance in the E4 show in the next few weeks, has enlisted the help of a personal trainer to keep her looking trim. FEMAIL recently caught up with  the fitness aficionado and the man behind her new physique to find out the workout that keeps her in shape. Speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness, Lucy, 23, said: 'I'm motivated by people around me and I just got to a point in my life where I needed a change.' Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, who owns  Enhance Nutrition LDN in London and trains Lucy, said: 'Lucy and I met when we worked together on the Made in Chelsea fitness DVD. 'Lucy was one of the cast members who took part in my workout. After the DVD, she wanted to continue with her training and I asked to work with her.' Lucy models cut-out swimwear and kaftans that the brand say are perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar . Discussing Lucy's physique and fitness before they met, Ashton said: 'Lucy has always had a naturally lean body, which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance. 'She also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats. Her fitness levels weren\u2019t terrible but they also weren\u2019t where they could have been, which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one.' Lucy, who cites her role model as 'amazing' Jessica Alba, said she found working out 'boring' and 'difficult' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it  hard to get into a routine. Lucy's typical workout  incorporates a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes . She said: 'My days are always different and I could never get properly into it. I think it's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me.' Lucy says she likes exercise 'where you don't even realise you're exercising', like tennis or horse riding. But, she says, thanks to Ashton, who is always changing it up and is fun to be around, she never gets bored any more. 'I don't want to emulate anyone else's body,' she admits. 'I just want mine to be toned and lean. I don't want to lose any weight or curves, just tone up what I already have. I also want to increase my strength.' So how can we emulate her taut stomach? Ashton said: 'Lucy has a great flat tummy but isn\u2019t looking for washboard abs. In our sessions, we concentrate on a mixture of core exercises like planks and side planks as these help to pull in your waist. 'We then add lower ab exercises such as reverse crunches as lower abs are often overlooked. On top of this, we add rotational movements such as seated twists. This ensures Lucy has both a flat stomach and a strong core for the bigger exercises such as squats and deadlifts.' He added: 'Lucy also ensures her diet is clean, luckily there wasn\u2019t much we needed to change but its true what they say, abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen.' Ashton and Lucy's typical workout  will incorporate a big lift such as a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes. Lucy showed off her style credentials at the F&F AW15 show in London last week . Lucy has also been following a healthy diet, which she posts on her Instagram page, to complement her fitness regime. As her trainer says,\u00a0abs are built in the gym but revealed in the kitchen . The duo then follow this up with mini circuits concentrating on working the body in single leg movements such as walking lunges and upper body push and pull exercises like press-ups. 'Every session is a full body session to keep her body balanced and injury-free and we often throw in HIIT (high intensity interval training) finishers to add in a cardio element,' he said. Ashton believes that, like Lucy, more and more women are embracing weight training, which he thinks is, in part, due to some 'fantastic and beautiful athletic role models out there'. He added: 'Everyone trains for different reasons. There are strong people, there are skinny people, but what is important is that people are allowed to feel comfortable in their bodies. Having people like Lucy show young females that you can enjoy life, eat well, train and reap the rewards is great.'

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for\u00a0Lauren's Fight For Cure\u00a0about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 \u2014 a date that matches Hill's uniform number \u2014 but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

A City high flier jumped \u2018feet first\u2019 in front of a train after leaving his job at an investment management company to spend more time with his family, an inquest heard today. Jay Kantaria, 38, from Harrow, north-west London, had been looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party when he leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill. But a coroner recorded an open verdict on the cause of death, saying there was 'doubt' as to Mr Kantaria's intention when he jumped as a train passed through the station last October. North London Coroner's Court in Barnet was told the businessman had \u2018recently\u2019 left his senior position at Baring Asset Management to start a career in property development. The London School of Economics graduate died instantly of \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019 and had to be identified from his fingerprints. Coroner Andrew Walker expressed his \u2018deepest sympathies\u2019 to Mr Kantaria\u2019s 37-year-old wife, Monica, and his surviving family. He said Nairobi-born Mr Kantaria had worked as the chairman's assistant at Baring, but had decided to become a property developer. The coroner said the cause of death was \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019, consistent with being struck by a rapidly-moving train. Mr Kantaria had no alcohol or drugs in his system and did not suffer from any known psychiatric problems, Mr Walker added. Location: Mr Kantaria leapt onto the tracks at his local station of Sudbury Hill (above) in north-west London . Train driver Michael Hughes recounted how Mr Kantaria \u2018seemed to have a good look at my train\u2019. Mr Hughes said in a statement: \u2018I then lost sight of him. When I passed the bridge I saw who I believe to be the same male run to the edge of the platform and jump feet-first.' He added that he felt no impact but immediately activated the emergency brake and called for help. Detective Constable Terry Hancocks from British Transport Police said: \u2018The line speed was 100mph. He [Mr Hughes] was travelling at about 85mph\u2019. The investigator said Mr Kantaria \u2018appears to move from the platform... and then he is caught by the camera just in the air, before being struck by the train\u2019. The coroner advised Mr Kantaria\u2019s family not to view stills from the CCTV footage. Scene: The businessman died instantly of \u2018a severe traumatic brain injury\u2019 at the station (seen from above) Mr Hancocks said: \u2018I did speak to Mrs Kantaria. The gentleman had just given up his job to spend more time with his wife and children and it was completely, completely out of character. As far as the family are concerned, it was completely out of the blue.\u2019 When the coroner indicated he was ready to record the death as a suicide, Mrs Kantaria, a senior auditor at JP Morgan Chase, said: \u2018He had everything to live for. 'He was looking forward to his daughter\u2019s birthday party the following week. There is no reason I have to believe that he intended his life to come to an end.\u2019 The coroner replied: \u2018In the circumstances, I think there is a doubt in my mind about what his intention was, so I am going to leave the conclusion open. Jay Kantaria jumped in front of a train at Sudbury Hill station and died. 'The conclusion, for the reason I have said, is an open conclusion. There is no evidence to suggest he was at risk of bringing his life to an end. He had everything to live for and it just doesn\u2019t seem to make sense.\u2019 Mr Kantaria had also worked at Wellington Management and Halbis CapitalManagement - and had strengths in \u2018communication and relationship management\u2019, according to his Linkedin profile.",

A son of Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul was pulled over on suspicion of driving under the influence on Sunday. However William Hilton Paul, 22, was not arrested. Paul was driving a 2006 Honda Ridgeline at 11.24am when he crashed into the back of an unoccupied parked car, in Lexington, Kentucky, according to police. Some people nearby heard the crash and alerted authorities. Witnesses said Paul was 'revving his engine' while sitting alone in the truck, reported\u00a0Kentucky.com. Lexington Police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts said Paul was treated at the University of Kentucky hospital for minor injuries to his face. Paul failed a field sobriety test, reported\u00a0Lex18.com. He refused blood and breathalyzer tests at the hospital. Although the 22-year-old had 'bloodshot, watery eyes' and was behaving in a 'belligerent' way according to the report, he was not arrested. Roberts said that is standard protocol for a case in which a DUI suspect is hospitalized. The 22-year-old student is scheduled to be arraigned in Fayette District Court on May 12. Paul,  a senior at the University of Kentucky majoring in communications, has two previous alcohol-related run-ins with the law. In October 2013, Paul was cited for possession of alcohol by a minor by the Kentucky Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control while drinking at a racetrack. In January 2013, Paul was charged with assaulting a female flight attendant, underage consumption, disorderly conduct, and being intoxicated and disruptive when his flight arrived at the airport. Those charges were dropped after Paul completed alcohol education classes and community service. On Sunday,  a police officer cited Paul for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and failure of a nonowner/operator to maintain insurance. Paul was alone at the time of the crash. A campaign spokesman said Senator Rand Paul does not comment on any private matters with regards to his family.

A destroyer equipped with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel along with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. A map showing the how jets were launched from RAF Lossiemouth yesterday, shortly after HMS Argyll was deployed to monitor a Russian destroyer and two other ships as they passed through the English Channel . Just a few hours later, two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace \u2013 prompting the RAF to deploy two Typhoon fighter jets. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to \u2018snoop\u2019 on a huge Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons\u2019 base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled. No explanation: Experts said Russian President Vladimir Putin's move to send planes capable of carrying cruise missiles so close to British shores could be seen as an act of aggression .

Under watch: The Royal Navy monitored a Russian Udaloy class destroyer (not pictured) along with a tanker and a support ship as they passed through the English Channel .

October 2014\u00a0- RAF Typhoons intercepted a Russian Bear aircraft over the North Sea and Russian warships pass through the Channel escorted by the Navy . October 30, 2014 - 26 Russian bombers, tankers and fighter jets on military exercises are intercepted around Europe in just 24 hours. Jets are scrambled by the RAF and allies in Germany, Portugal and Turkey after the 'unusual' spike in activity, which saw two giant Tu-95 Bear H bombers fly close to Britain . November 2014 - HMS Argyll monitors a heavily armed Russian warship as it strayed close to the UK while passing through the English Channel and Strait of Dover . January 2015 - Typhoons were dispatched from RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland and RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to intercept two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles as they flew south of Bournemouth . February 17, 2015 - HMS Argyll intercepts a Neustrashimy-class warship and its accompanying tanker as they headed home after a deployment in the Mediterranean in the English Channel . February 19, 2015 - Two RAF Typhoon jets scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire to escort two Russian bombers in international airspace off the coast of Cornwall. April 2015 - Royal Navy's HMS Argyll monitors Russian Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk along with a tanker and a support ship as they move through the English Channel. The incursions are the latest in a long line of apparent tests by Moscow as tensions between Britain and Russia rise. The Nato naval operation \u2013 Exercise Joint Warrior \u2013 was aimed at encouraging Mr Putin to calm his recent aggression toward the UK. But Sir Michael Graydon, former head of the RAF, said the Kremlin was using Cold War tactics to \u2018snoop\u2019 on the exercise and called for higher defence spending to defeat a \u2018resurgent\u2019 Russia. He said: \u2018This is a classic return to the 70s and 80s when every exercise conducted by Nato was snooped on. \u2018We\u2019ve trumpeted the fact we are holding such a large exercise and the fact they are snooping on it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\u2019 He added that Britain should spend more on defence: \u2018Our capability to deal with these sorts of threats is diminishing because we don\u2019t have the manpower... we need resilience.\u2019 A source added: \u2018It may be that they are observing the military exercise being held off the coast of Scotland.\u2019 Under a European treaty, the Ministry of Defence were forced to accept an inspection by Russian experts and they arrived in Scotland on Monday. Yesterday the destroyer Severomorsk, a tanker and a support ship returning from the Mediterranean were intercepted by the Royal Navy as they passed through the Channel. Plymouth-based HMS Argyll, a Type 23 frigate with a crew of 185, was sent to monitor the vessels. A source said the Russians may \u2018poke their noses in at the exercise off Scotland\u2019 before heading home. An RAF spokesman said the two Bear bombers, which flew off the north-east coast of Scotland hours later, were escorted away. More than 100 Russian aircraft were intercepted last year, three times more than during the whole of 2013. In November a four-strong Russian flotilla sailed through the Channel and earlier this year two Bears flew south of Bournemouth.

    "source": "Tragedy: Zachary Cain Stickler, 34, died the day after he pleaded not guilty to hitting his partner . A pilot has commited suicide by  intentionally crashing his plane into a field in Northern California the day after pleading not guilty to domestic violence charges, authorities said Tuesday . Zachary Cain Stickler, 34, had been accused of physically assaulting his then-partner in February, and appeared Shasta County Superior Court in Redding on Friday. Before the crash on Saturday, Stickler had sent text messages to friends and family indicating he was distraught and planned to kill himself. He had been charged with  felony count of making criminal threats and a misdemeanor battery charge, Chief Deputy District Attorney Stephanie Bridgett said. The charges stemmed from an argument in February in Redding, California, that escalated and became physical, Bridgett said. The alleged victim was living with Stickler at the time and reported an attack in their home. According to the police report, she claimed Stickler had gotten violent and then left their home, and that her cellphone had been destroyed in the process. She declined medical attention. Stickler killed himself by crashing into a pasture in in Millville, California, about 20miles from Redding, on Saturday morning, Shasta County Sheriff's Deputy Dustin Reynolds said. Sheriff's officials responded to a report of an explosion around 8:30am and found a small debris field at the site where the single-engine Cessna crashed. There was no indication Stickler had wanted to hurt anyone else, Reynolds added. A former boss has spoken of his shock at hearing of Stickler's death and the domestic violence charges. Crash: It is believed Stickler intentionally crashed his Cessna plane into a field in California on Saturday, after texting family and friends that he was 'distraught' and planned on taking his own life . Jason Lamberton, chief operating officer at AFT Center Flight Training in Long Beach, California, where Stickler worked last year described him as a 'skilled trainer who had good rapport with students'. 'I'm absolutely shocked. There was nothing like that whatsoever in his behavior. 'The young man was very professional with what he did here. We were really happy with him.' Lamberton also said that Stickler had left the company in order for his girlfriend could pursue an opportunity elsewhere, and that he had offered to provide the 34-year-old with a reference. More recently, Stickler worked for Aperture Aviation, an aerial photography company, which extended its sympathies to his family and friends in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration has assigned two inspectors to the crash, one of whom may conduct an on-site inspection, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said.",

    "source": "Washington (CNN)Until recently, if you sat in church on Sunday mornings, pollsters could predict where you stood on same-sex marriage. What a difference a decade makes. In 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court became the country's first to legalize same-sex marriage, less than 30% of religiously affiliated Americans supported gays' and lesbians' right to wed. By 2014, that number had climbed to 47%, according to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute. That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials. The margin is small but statistically significant, said Robert P. Jones, CEO of PRRI, because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents: 40,000 adult Americans. (Eight percent refused to answer or said they didn't know their stance on same-sex marriage.) According to PRRI's poll, there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it, a dramatic turn in one of this country's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race. \"There's been a huge swing in the last decade,\" said Jones. \"There are now big, mainstream groups on both sides of the debate.\" If the U.S. Supreme Court has been paying attention, it likely saw this trend coming. Each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage, the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller, and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse. On Tuesday, for example, as the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage, an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of Washington's National Cathedral is planning to march in support of LGBT rights. \"I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states,\" the Very Rev. Gary Hall, the cathedral's dean, said in a statement. \"I trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek God's blessing on their marriages.\" Clergy from Hall's religious denomination, the Episcopal Church, have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage. The brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders, including rabbis, Methodist ministers, Lutheran bishops, seminary professors and Congregationalist chaplains. Another brief, submitted by the Anti-Defamation League, is signed by Jewish, Hindu and Presbyterian groups. In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials. Prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Association of Evangelicals, Southern Baptist Convention, Assemblies of God and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church. Together, leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million Americans. But as PRRI's survey shows, there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews. Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage. That's a huge increase from 2003, when just 35% backed gay rights, according to survey conducted at the time by the Pew Research Center. Mainline Protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century American life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade. While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do. At a glance, the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse, encompassing Buddhists, Catholics, Jews and Hindus. But the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley, bridging black Protestants, Mormons, Muslims and white evangelicals, according to PRRI's survey. Same-sex marriage rights worldwide . Legalized nationwide:Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, South Africa, Sweden . Legalized in certain regions:Brazil, Mexico, United States . Civil unions or domestic partnerships:Andorra, Austria, Brazil, Colombia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Greenland, Hungary, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay and parts of Australia, Mexico, United States and Venezuela . The survey data comes from PRRI's American Values Atlas, conducted between April and December of last year. PRRI is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and American culture. Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans. Seven in 10 Millennials, for example, support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics. Half of millennial Republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry, and 43% of white evangelical millennials agree. Those numbers could put GOP presidential candidates in a tight spot, said Jones, as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger Americans. \"The real challenge for GOP candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation,\" Jones said. Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky. \"For me, the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue. There are periods when the Gospel is popular and periods when it's not. You can't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment.\" Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. But the fight is far from over, Burk said. \"Just like we've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion, we're going to see the same thing with gay marriage.\"",

When Ukip leader Nigel Farage interjected and said they were prejudiced, \u2018even by the Left-wing standards of the BBC\u2019, the audience only booed him further. Scroll down for video . Bias: When Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) said the audience was prejudiced, they only booed him further . David Dimbleby, who hosted Thursday night\u2019s debate between the Labour, Ukip, Green, SNP and Plaid Cymru leaders, pointed out that the audience had not been selected by the BBC, but by a \u2018reputable polling organisation\u2019, later to be revealed to be ICM. The BBC initially refused to disclose the political make-up of the audience but eventually released figures late yesterday. Of the 200-strong audience, about 58 were Conservative or Ukip supporters while about 102 backed left-leaning parties \u2013 Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru or the SNP. The rest \u2013 40 \u2013 described themselves as undecided. The figures mean just 36 per cent of the audience members with a declared political allegiance were supporters of the Tories or Ukip. But the latest ICM poll for the Guardian put the Tories on 39 per cent and Ukip on 7 per cent \u2013 a total of 46 per cent overall. Last night Mr Farage said: \u2018If the audience make-up didn\u2019t reflect that then it\u2019s wrong.\u2019 Out in the cold: Ukip leader Nigel Farage cuts a isolated figure at the end of the BBC TV debate on Thursday . The BBC told ICM to make sure a fifth were so-called floating voters, and for every five Labour supporters in the room, it made sure there were five for the Conservatives, four for the Lib Dems, two for the Scottish National Party, two for the Green Party and one for Plaid Cymru. The figures suggest supporters of the Tories and Ukip were significantly under-represented. ICM admitted that it recruited almost all of its audience members London. The company said in a statement that it identified \u201830 small geographical areas\u2019 within a 20-mile radius of the Westminster debate hall and found at least eight people from each one. It also selected a \u2018small number\u2019 of SNP and Plaid Cymru from Scotland and Wales using an undisclosed method \u2018reasonably decided upon by ICM\u2019. The company refused to answer any other questions about the matter. Yesterday the BBC refused to disclose how many people had complained about its broadcast. \u2018Our data shows the number of audience contacts were heavily influenced by the issue being raised during the debate and therefore we won\u2019t be giving out figures,\u2019 a BBC spokesman said. Conservative MP Andrew Percy said: \u2018The audience should reflect the opinion polls and the fact is that nearly half of the country say they would vote Conservative of Ukip,\u2019 \u2018You have to ask yourself what would have happened if the audience had been right of centre. The left would have had a field day. They would have been so holier-than-thou.\u2019 John Hemming, Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the BBC\u2019s behaviour was \u2018ludicrous\u2019 and its refusal to publish the number of complaints \u2018added insult to injury\u2019. The contest saw Labour's Ed Miliband, SNP's Nicola Sturgeon, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Green's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood go head-to-head .",

United have been considering a bid for the forward as they look to freshen up their forward options, with Radamel Falcao expected to return to Monaco, and Robin van Persie failing to hold down a starting place. But the PSG striker, who missed several chances during his side's Champions League defeat to Barcelona on Wednesday, insisted there is 'too much talk' about his future, and he is happy in Paris. Edinson Cavani attempts a diving header during the defeat to Barcelona at the Parc des Princes . The Uruguayan forward is a target for Manchester United but looks set to stay in Paris . 'There is too much talk about my future but I will remain here,' Cavani told Sky Italia after the Barcelona defeat. 'I will respect my contract and I'm only focusing on doing well for PSG.' Cavani has not been as instrumental to the club's fortunes this season as he was last year but came off the bench to score twice against Bastia in Saturday's League Cup final win. PSG are thought to have doubts about the future of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and should he leave they would certainly want to keep Cavani. The Uruguayan joined the French champions in a \u00a350million deal from Napoli in the summer of 2013. Club owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi ruled out his sale last week, claiming he is loved at the Parc des Princes. 'Edinson Cavani is a player I really like,' Al-Khelaifi told Le Parisien. 'I can tell you that he is very much with us, and the question of his departure has not arisen. Paris loves him and he loves Paris.'

The official refused to comment on how many such satellites there were, and which countries were operating them. It suggests there could be more satellites than thought monitoring different countries on Earth. The claim was made by the commander of Russian Space Command. Oleg Maidanovich said someone was hiding satellites as space junk (artist's illustration of a satellite shown). But in a film he refused to name the country behind the ruse . The claims were made by the commander of Russian Space Command, Oleg Maidanovich. He was speaking on a film called \u2018Space Special Forces\u2019 during a tour of Russia\u2019s main centre for aerospace intelligence in Krasnoznamensk, near Moscow. \u2018Very recently, specialists of the department of space intelligence centre uncovered a newly created group of space satellites... made for radio-technical reconnaissance of equipment on Russian territory,\u2019 he said. A reconnaissance satellite is unofficially referred to as a spy satellite. They are Earth observation satellites or communications satellites traditionally used for military or intelligence purposes. Some are used to simply take images from the ground, while others relay information from one place to another. Many such satellites are used today for high-resolution photography of certain areas, for scientific or defense purposes. The film goes on to state that there \u2018are cases when a space satellite pretends to be space junk for years and then wakes up and starts working at the right moment.\u2019 The comments were made yesterday on \u2018Space Day\u2019, when Russia commemorated the first human spaceflight - Yuri Gagarin, on 12 April 1961. Since then hundreds of rockets have been launched into space \u2013 and Russia itself now has about 140 satellites operating in orbit. Their Space Command is a division of the military responsible for warning of missile and air strikes and controlling Russia's defence satellites. It monitors about 20,000 objects orbiting the planet, out of a total of 100,000 significant objects. Some objects are believed to have a military purpose - but it\u2019s not quite clear what the purpose of the satellites disguised as space junk are. MailOnline has asked the Russian space agency (Roscosmos) and Space Command for further information on the claim.

The catwalk was replaced with a tennis court, the front row with stadium seating, and the usual parade of slender models walking single file was nowhere in sight. Instead, four strong, muscular women sashayed onto the grass, and proceeded to stretch and bend their bodies into yoga poses. Lindy Klim, along with former Commonwealth Games pole vaulter Amanda Bisk, Australian Ballet star Juliette Burnett, and Yogi and Instagram star Sjana Earp, wowed the crowds as they struck strong poses.

The show opening made clear: We Are Handsome are celebrating strong, healthy shapes - the type of people they have designed their new Activewear collection for.

They carried tennis rackets, volleyballs, and skipping ropes as they walked the border of the tennis court showcasing high-tech sports-luxe fabrications. Influencers: Lindy Klim (left) and Sjana Earp (right), both fitness enthusiasts, modelled wares from We Are Handsome's new Activewear range . Daily Mail Australia spoke to the 'models' ahead of the show, which was held at White City Tennis Club in Paddington. Lindy Klim was excited to be returning to the 'catwalk' for the first time in nine years, and since becoming a mother. The beautiful 37-year-old said she wasn't nervous despite being absent from the runway in nearly a decade, and the age difference between herself and the other participants. 'I\u2019m quite comfortable with myself. I\u2019m older than most girls here but 'I'm quite comfortable with my body and exercise a lot so it\u2019s a good fit,' she said, adding that the We Are Handsome message aligned with her health and fitness philosophies. Fashion Week star Samantha Harris was one of the few 'traditional' models in the show . Athletic: The brand emphasised strong fitness-focused women above traditional runway models . Klim told DMA that there is a start contrast in her fitness and diet habits when she is in Australia versus her life at home in Bali. 'I exercise in Bali for two hours a day, but then when I'm in Australia I don't exercise at all,' she revealed, adding that in Australia she struggles to find the time in her schedule. 'My diet in Bali is a lot healthier in Bali than it is in Australia. It's so much easier to eat really healthy food there, it's all organic, locally grown food. 'We don't snack in Bali either - we don't have chips and lollies and things, so I find it a lot easier to eat over there. 'When I'm in Australia I love to go out to restaurants, drink red wine, and i do that a lot during Fashion Week as well as its so social.' Sjana Earp told DMA that she thought there had been a mistake when she was asked to model in a Fashion Week show. Yogis on the field: Flow Athletic co-owner Kate Kendall (left) and pole vaulter turned yogi Amanda Bisk (right) had starring roles in the show . Lifestyle: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Lindy revealed that she works out for two hours a day at home in Bali, and finds it a lot easier to eat healthily there than in Australia, where her social life sees her out for dinner most nights . The 20-year-old has a huge following on Instagram, where 680,000 followers are glued to her daily yoga poses. 'At first I was confused and double checked it was for runway,' she said. 'I was told fitness influencers were involved, so that was exciting, then I realised it was different from \u2018normal modelling\u2019. '[We Are Handsome] have picked up on the fact social media has such a power for advertising. 'We\u2019re all just regular girls, I think that we\u2019re helping to promote a healthy body image.

'There\u2019s a big thing about \"who should be on the runway\" so we know we\u2019re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before (and who are nervous about it),' Katinka told Daily Mail Australia. 'But the rules are there to be broken, times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape. Strong really is the new sexy.'

Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by\u00a0Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing\u00a0Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought \"you're not gay, you're transgender.\"' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying;\u00a0'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.",

The officer, Ben Johnson, who has been on the force four years, was answering reports of a drunk woman inside Deluxe Nails at a strip mall in Red Rock on Tuesday. When he arrived, he contained 27-year-old Viviana Keith, who was walking toward her car, and began handcuffing her. Johnson claims the woman started resisting him, forcing him to pull a fast and forceful take-down, however video taken on his cash cam and by a person in a nearby shop appear to show a different story.

The main who took the video, who wished to remain anonymous, said he believed it was an excessive use of force. 'When I look back at the tape, I can see her head bounce off the concrete because when he threw her down, she wasn't able to brace herself,' the man told KVUE. 'She was absolutely unconscious. 'There were a couple of other gentleman in the store with me and we were saying 'is she breathing?' 'Because at first we weren't seeing her stomach rise and fall.' Another witness, Viviana Garcia, said she thought the woman had died. Furthermore, the woman's daughter, who is six-years-old, also saw the incident unfold. 'It looked like she was dead,' Garcia told the network. 'The little girl was screaming, ''Mommy, mommy''.'

The Ashton Canal was filled with heavy suds which appeared after a fire at an industrial unit occupied by a drug development company. It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings. Scroll down for video . The Ashton Canal in Manchester, which was turned into a giant bubble bath when fire crews tackled a blaze at a nearby chemical plant . It is believed that the water used by firefighters to dampen down the flames mixed with the detergent being stored in the burning buildings . Three-year-old Jason Kernick looks out of the window of his family's canal boat as they try to navigate their way through the foam . This then turned into a huge wall of foam when it drained into the canal, which runs in the shadow of Manchester City's Etihad Stadium. Now the Environment Agency have launched an investigation to assess if the foam has impacted on wildlife after concerns were raised for the safety of fish in the affected waters. A spokesman for the agency said: 'The Environment Agency is investigating after receiving reports of foam on a 30 metre stretch of the Ashton Canal, Manchester. 'Initial investigations by Environment Agency officers show that there appears to have been minimal impact on water quality, but our officers will continue to monitor and respond as necessary. Richard Kernick takes a picture on his mobile phone of his boat trying to negotiate a lock and the foam, which ran into the Ashton Canal . A cyclist takes a picture on his mobile phone as the foam comes up on to the cycle path. The Environment Agency are investigating to assess of the foam has harmed any wildlife . The foam reached as high as six foot in some places and covered a 30 metre stretch along the water in the Clayton area of Manchester . 'We are working with the fire service and taking samples of the foam to understand what it is made of, and what impact it may have on local wildlife in and around the canal.' At the height of the blaze on Sunday afternoon, which caused the foam, up to 50 firefighters were tackling the fire and police were also forced to wear face masks. Families in east Manchester were urged to say indoors after a blast was reported at the industrial unit, which is just a few hundred yards from the Manchester City training ground on the Etihad campus. The fire at the chemical factory next to Manchester City's Etihad stadium send a huge plume of smoke across the city on Easter Sunday . Police wearing face masks went around neighbouring streets with loudspeakers urging people to stay inside while the fire raged . Police officers also told children on bikes and mothers pushing prams near the scene to go home and went around neighbouring streets with loudspeakers urging people to stay inside. A huge plume of smoke also turned the sky black and could be seen right across the city and even into Salford. According to Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, the fire was fueled by wooden pallets and unidentified chemicals but an investigation into the cause of the fire is still ongoing.",

The club have said in a statement they will appeal on the grounds the incident that left Northampton wing George North unconscious and resulted in a red card for Hughes was an accident and no foul play had occurred. With the hearing scheduled to be held next Friday, it means Hughes can not be reprieved in time to face the reigning European champions in Toulon this weekend. Wasps are set to appeal the three-match ban handed to No 8 Nathan Hughes for knocking out George North . North was out cold on the pitch at Franklin's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher . Hughes' knee collided with North's head as he crossed the line to score a try for Northampton . Hughes was given the suspension - to include three meaningful fixtures - after being found guilty of striking North in the 52-30 Aviva Premiership defeat at Franklin's Gardens on March 27. Commenting on the judgement made on Tuesday night, disciplinary officer Sir James Dingemans said: 'This was a three week ban on the basis that no intention was found. 'However, there was recklessness meaning that, notwithstanding the harm, it was a low entry point of four weeks with mitigation of one week to reflect his previous clean playing record.'

Dominic Solanke scored late on to put a gloss on the scoreline after a Tammy Abraham double had seen Chelsea take a first half lead. Sportsmail was at the Academy Stadium to see how the youngsters got on... Tammy Abraham smashes Chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner . Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Kjetil Haug: Norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball. That said, powerless to stop Abraham's volleys and Soalnke's killer. 6.5 . Pablo Maffeo: Barcelona-born former Espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with Chelsea's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled. 6.5 . Tosin Adarabioyo: Manchester lad and England youth international, City's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence. Has the movement of Yaya Toure but put a big shift in. 7 . Christian Haug goes up for the ball under pressure from Chelsea forwards during the Youth Cup final . Cameron Humphreys-Grant: Has captained England and, like Adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant Chelsea attack but stood up to the test well. 6.5 . Jose Angelino Tasende: Spanish left-back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition. 6 . Kean Bryan: Box-to-box midfielder from Beswick, yards away from the Etihad Stadium, pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up. 6.5 . Manchester City midfielder Kean Bryan tracks the run of Dominic Solanke as City looked to stem the tide . Aaron Nemane: Moved to Manchester from France as a toddler, the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the Semi Final did outwitted Dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final, killer ball. Blasted wide when should have levelled. 6.5 . Bersant Celina: Kosovan international Celina struggled to fill in for injured star Thierry Ambrose, seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by Collins. 6 . Manu Garcia: Joined City from Sporting Gijon and the mini David Silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space. Was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by Barker late on. Yanked on 85 minuted. 6 . Manuel Garcia gets a shot away, but it was blocked by Jake Clarke-Salter . Isaac Buckley-Ricketts: Pacy Mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring City level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening. 7 . Brandon Barker: City's star man, the two-footed local lad is tipped for big things at the Etihad but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here. Did create a fine chance for Garcia with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on. 7.5 . City's players celebrate after Isaac Buckley (left) had levelled the game in the first half . Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Bradley Collins: The Southampton-born stopper could do little about City's opener and distributed the ball well. 6.5 . Fikayo Tomori: Canadian born but eligible for England combined well with Clarke-Salter to nullify City's threat in a commanding-looking partnership. 7 . Ola Aina: England Under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right. Quick, strong and often influential. 7 . Jake Clarke-Salter: England Under 18s international often too strong for Buckley-Ricketts and, on the evidence of this sterling performance, is one to watch. 7 . Jay Dasilva: Under-21 regular is still 16. Fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward, whipping in a number of decent crosses. 7 . Ruben Sammut: Scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as City pressed. 6.5 . Ruben Sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four . Tammy Abraham: Two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season. Big, bold and often brilliant, Chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious. 8 . Charlie Colkett: Put in a captain's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle. Is tipped for big things and showed just why. 7.5 . Abraham makes it 2-1 at the Academy Stadium with an acrobatic finish past\u00a0Christian Haug . Dominic Solanke: Scored for England in the European Under-17 Championship Final and put in a powerful shift here, teaming up well with Abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third. 7.5 . Charly Musonda: The Belgian playmaker, the only overseas man in the starting XI, was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide. Departed late on. 6 . Isaiah Brown: Said to be interesting Jose Mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box. Miss aside, was a constant menace. Substitutes: . Kasey Palmer (Abraham, 67, 6): On for Abraham and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar. Isaiah Brown holds off a tackle from Fikayo Tomori, during another impressive display for the young forward .",

The Dutchman greeted a group of supporters with life-limiting illnesses at the biannual Manchester Foundation Dream Day held at the Aon Training Complex on Monday. And Moshin Tanveer - who suffers from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy - used the special occasion to provide the former Holland boss with a star-studded cast of Europe's top property he should sign in order to bring the Barclays Premier League title back to Old Trafford.

'I did some homework for you,' the fan tells van Gaal, passing him the dossier seen in a video posted on the Manchester United YouTube channel. The United boss then reads out the names of Mats Hummels, Nathaniel Clyne, Paul Pogba, Gareth Bale, Memphis Depay and Jackson Martinez, before thanking the supporter for his advice. 'I take it in mind,' van Gaal says, before folding the sheet of paper and putting it in his pocket. 'You are smart, and a very cheap manager.' Tanveer told the Dutchman not to follow up the loan signing of Radamel Falcao with a permanent deal, and also suggested that striker Robin van Persie should be sold. The supporter's mentor said he had spent a week writing up his shortlist ahead of the foundation day, and after being warmly received by the manager, the beaming recipient of a signed home shirt said, 'It was really nice of him to do that. It was like a dream come true.' Dutchman reads out the names of Mats Hummels, Gareth Bale and Paul Pogba  among others .

    "source": "London (CNN)The Hatton Garden heist, as it will surely come to be known, was every safe deposit box holder's nightmare, every movie director's dream. Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. And they reportedly got away with hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of gems and cash -- even, in the educated guess of one former police official, as much as 200 million pounds, or $300 million. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a \"slow and painstaking\" forensic examination, police said in a statement. \"Officers anticipate the process to take approximately two days,\" the statement said. \"At this stage it is believed that approximately 60-70 safe deposit boxes were opened during the burglary. Officers are working closely with Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd to establish the identities of those affected. Police will be contacting victims directly as and when they are identified.\" WATCH: Top five jewelry heists . Throughout the day Wednesday, customers of the business went in and out of the premises, clearly unhappy about not being able to learn whether their boxes were among those ransacked. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade. The area's promotional website says it is home to \"the largest and most concentrated cluster of jewellery retailers in the UK\" and has been for quite some time. \"History tells us that the old City of London had certain streets -- or quarters -- dedicated to specific types of business,\" the website says. \"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. \"Today, it maintains its international reputation as the centre of London's diamond trade. It is one of the finest and most renowned jewellery locations in the world.\" $4.8M in gold swiped from N.C. highway. But how? The police statement did not put a value on the amount of the haul. But numerous British news organizations put the figure in the hundreds of thousands of pounds, which translates into even more hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. But Roy Ramm, a former chief of the Flying Squad, an economic crime unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service, came up with a much higher guess. \"I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen,\" Ramm said on BBC Radio 4. Because of the long Easter weekend, police did not hear of the robbery until Tuesday morning. This may prove to be an embarrassment, as the Telegraph newspaper reported that the alarm at the business sounded Friday but, as the front and back doors still appeared locked, no action was taken. The website of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. says the company was founded in 1954 and offers a \"secure and cost-effective solution to store and protect important and irreplaceable personal belongings.\" Robbers target security vans in France jewel heist .",

    "source": "Lauren Crawley was given a new platinum implant . Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage\u00a0of stroke patients\u00a0who are affected\u00a0by facial\u00a0weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around \u00a33,000 privately. The NHS does not automatically fund it .",

    "source": "(CNN)A Saudi-led coalition Tuesday ended its \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- its nearly monthlong airstrike campaign in Yemen -- and a new initiative is underway. \"Operation Renewal of Hope\" will focus on the political process. Saudi Arabia had launched airstrikes on Houthi positions across Yemen, hoping to wipe out the Iranian-allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power. The Saudis say they want to restore the Yemeni government, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda, which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year. This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in the capital Sanaa. The campaign achieved its objectives \"by a very good planning, very precise execution, by the courage of our pilots, our sailors, our soldiers,\" said Brig. Gen. Ahmed Asiri, a Saudi military spokesman. A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to \"nearly all demands\" of the U.N. Security Council. Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said. A statement from the Saudi Embassy in Washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations, including protecting civilians, enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance, confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security. Ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation, Asiri said. Military action will be taken if needed. But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation. The aim is to bring back Yemen's \"security and stability through establishing a political process,\" said a statement from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. Ousted Yemen President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi thanked the Saudi-led coalition. Hadi claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. \"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen,\" Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at \"the right time\" to rebuild the country. \"You will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military, far from rebel militancy,\" said Hadi. Also Tuesday, a U.S. military official told CNN that the United States is conducting \"manned reconnaissance\" off Yemen. The official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships over the last days was not done to interdict Iranian ships, but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? CNN's Jethro Mullen, Tim Lister, Anas Hamdan, Jamie Crawford and journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report.",

    "source": "(CNN)\"It really depends what you want. Boy? Girl? Young? Old?\" The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader. After a week of back and forth phone calls, his initial caginess had given way to greed. He'd heard my foreign accent and clearly decided I would pay more than the domestic rate. \"We can get,\" he said. We'd been put in touch with the man through a contact on the ground. We were told he was one of the men running this \"unofficial\" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps. It had all been heartbreakingly simple. We'd asked who had children available to \"foster\" -- a catch-all code word designed to conceal the true intent of those offering up the orphaned children. The man on the phone was the end result of those inquiries. When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take. One, two maybe? He escaped by saying he needed to check with his \"madam\" -- me. I called. The man picked up and began referring to me as \"sister.\" I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to \"foster\" the children. He told me, \"Sister, Jesus will reward me,\" so the \"fostering\" was free, he said. No need for any pesky paperwork -- just a reassurance from me that the children, if I chose to take them, would \"live in my heart.\" If I could also then find it \"in my heart\" to donate to those still in the camp, then that would be \"God's work.\" In spite of the harsh measures the Nigerian government has put in place to punish human traffickers, by the government's own admission, 8 million children are currently engaged in forced labor. The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country. Paradoxically, the group also rates Nigeria's anti-trafficking agency, Naptip, as one of the strongest government responses on the continent -- but it's clearly overwhelmed by the realities of working in what is now a zone of military operations, Nigeria's north. As the insecurity in the region has spiraled, the worry is that more and more children are falling through the cracks. And as Boko Haram increases its reliance on child suicide bombers, concerns are growing that orphaned children could end up in the hands of the terror group. At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge. We spoke in normal tones in full view of the children playing. I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old. Did I want to consider an older girl? A 12-year-old maybe? She could look after the 3-year-old, and cook and clean. Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said. I could see them then. Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate \"donation\" would be in exchange for the children. He couldn't, he said, bargain for it. He then proceeded to do just that, laughing down the phone at my first tentative guess of $200. Laughing again at $300. We finally found a figure he didn't find funny -- $500. I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.",

    "source": "The blue-eyed doctor who fled to join the Islamic State is still allowed to practice medicine in Australia despite appearing in a propaganda video encouraging foreign medics to join a terrorist cult. Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh featured in the latest ISIS propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward as he urged people to join the death cult notorious for beheading non-Muslims. Despite his public support for ISIS, Dr Kamleh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board has refused to deregister him, the\u00a0Advertiser\u00a0reports. Former Adelaide doctor Tareq Kamleh, who fled to join the Islamic State, is still allowed to practice medicine in Australia despite appearing in a propaganda video encouraging foreign medics to join the terrorist cult . The Medical Board of Australia can deregister doctors convicted of crimes and can take action against those whose conduct goes against being a 'fit and proper person'. But no action has yet been taken against Dr Kamleh. 'The role of the Medical Board of Australia is to protect the public and manage risk to patients,' the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency said. 'The Board and AHPRA are not able to comment on this matter now, as doing so could compromise any future regulatory action.' Calling himself 'Abu Yusuf', Kamleh\u00a0featured in the latest ISIS propaganda video at the weekend wearing western-style surgical scrubs and handling babies in a maternity ward . Dr Kamleh, who completed his medical dress at Adelaide University, worked as a paediatric registrar at the Adelaide Women's and Children's Hospital until 2013. He then moved to north Queensland where he worked at Mackay Base Hospital, before working in Perth until late 2014. Dr Kamleh appeared in the ISIS recruitment video at the weekend calling for foreign medics to join him in the city of Raqqa to help launch the Islamic State Health Service. The video quickly went viral and caused his former medical colleagues in Australia to speak out. It has emerged Dr Kamleh has claimed he had unprotected sex with a Royal Adelaide Hospital patient who was a former sex worker and intravenous drug user after he checked her medical records, according to The Australian. Despite his public support for ISIS, Dr Kamleh still remains registered to practice medicine in Australia until September 30 because the Medical Board refused to deregister him . Dr Kamleh appeared in the ISIS recruitment video at the weekend calling for foreign medics to join him in the city of Raqqa to help launch the Islamic State Health Service . He also claimed to have slept with a patient at the Mannum District Hospital in South Australia. A former colleague who worked with Dr\u00a0Kamleh during his stint at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2010 said he was a sexually manipulative 'creep', a 'fraud' and a 'sleazeball'. They also said he had a number of sexual relationships with nurses, doctors and other hospital staff, drank to excess and had a strong interest in shooting. 'I feel reluctant to speak ill of a former colleague, but as he is now portraying himself as a jihadist and calling others to join the so-called caliphate, I feel I should,' the colleague, who declined to be named, said. 'At the time, he was one of the most immoral people I knew, in terms of promiscuity at least.' The doctor completed his medical degree at Adelaide University and worked at various hospitals before fleeing Australia\u00a0on a flight to Kuala Lumpur last month . The vision of Dr Kamleh handling babies in a maternity unit is the latest in a string of high budget propaganda videos from the depraved militant group . Another ex-colleague from South Australia said he had undergone a 'character transformation' over the past year. They claimed to have heard\u00a0Kamleh\u00a0had become 'devout' to such an extent he considered platonic friendships with women inappropriate, and he 'thought the way he had been living was wrong'. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton confirmed Dr\u00a0Kamleh\u00a0left the country on a flight to Kuala Lumpur last month. 'Reports on the weekend in relation to an Australian doctor going to serve in Syria are deeply disturbing,' Mr Dutton said. 'For a highly educated doctor to succumb to the message of this death cult is concerning to all Australians.' He could be sentenced to up to 25 years prison time if he returns to Australia and is charged. A former colleague who worked with Dr Kamleh during his stint at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in 2010 said he was a sexually manipulative 'creep', a 'fraud' and a 'sleazeball' Kamel could be sentenced to up to 25 years prison time if he returns to Australia and is charged .",

    "source": "Britons spend an astonishing \u00a3100 million a year on cough syrup \u2013 when a glass of honey and lemon could work just as well, according to a new BBC television investigation. It claims that branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using \u2018clever marketing\u2019 to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products, and that some manufacturers simply use the same pills in different packaging throughout their ranges. Scroll down for video . 'Clever marketing': Dr Chris Van Tulleken with a range of packets that, he says, may contain exactly the same pills . The UK over-the-counter medicines market, which also includes painkillers and anti-fungal creams, is worth \u00a32.5 billion, with brands vying for attention with brightly coloured packaging and promises that are questionable under scrutiny, claims Dr Chris Van Tulleken. In The Truth About Medicine, to be broadcast on Thursday, Dr Van Tulleken, an infectious diseases specialist, warns we should think less about convenience and more about the effectiveness of medicines. There are three main types of over-the-counter cough remedies, those that contain suppressants to alleviate symptoms of a dry, tickly cough, syrups that reduce the urge to cough by coating the throat, and products that help to thin sticky mucus, making coughing easier. Some also contain paracetamol or ibuprofen, both of which reduce a temperature, decongestants and antihistamines that can help sleep. Yet an authoritative study from Cardiff University\u2019s Common Cold Centre claimed cough medicines work mostly through a placebo effect, and that just 15 per cent of the effect can be attributed to the medicines in them. PREVENT: Sores on the inside of the mouth or cheeks can be caused by damage to the lining of the mouth from hot foods, biting your cheek or even rubbing dentures. They can also be a sign of an iron or Vitamin B12 deficiency, so a balanced diet can help prevent them. Spicy foods and chocolate can be triggers, so keep a food diary if you have recurrent outbreaks to pinpoint problem foods. It\u2019s also worth checking your toothpaste \u2013 formulas that contain a foaming agent called sodium lauryl sulphate can cause mouth ulcers by reducing the protective mucus layer in the mouth. You might consider switching brands. TREAT: Over-the-counter antiseptic gels can bring relief from the stinging and help form a protective layer around the mouth ulcer to speed up healing. You could also try a medicated mouthwash containing chlorhexidine, which is anti-inflammatory and helps reduce bacteria. If you have had mouth ulcers for more than three weeks, go to your GP or dentist, who may prescribe steroids in the form of a tablet, mouth spray or gel. DON\u2019T BOTHER: Some people believe upping their Vitamin C intake will cure their mouth ulcers, as the vitamin is known to help the wound-healing process, but too much can actually irritate the mouth. Stick to the daily recommended allowance of 40mg per day (30mg for children aged one to ten) through a healthy diet. A study of 60 over-the-counter medicines found that all but two contained sweeteners such as honey or sucrose, which can stimulate saliva and mucus production. In the documentary, Dr Van Tulleken shows how an old-fashioned remedy of honey and lemon could be just the tonic to banish a troublesome cough. He inhales pepper spray into his lungs, which makes him cough, then takes a lemon-and-honey concoction. He inhales the pepper spray once more, but doesn\u2019t cough at all. Professor Alyn Morice of Hull University, who also appears in the programme, admits there is no good scientific answer as to why the home-made cure is as effective but, with no potential side effects, the health benefits are obvious. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), a trade association representing manufacturers of over-the-counter medicines, says that although it is difficult to test the effectiveness of cough medicines, as the severity and duration of symptoms can vary, research has shown they are rated as effective by 90 per cent of consumers. The film also reveals that UK families spend \u00a3350 million on a variety of painkillers, with packaging claiming to specifically target ailments such as period pain, headaches or muscular problems. For example, Nurofen and Feminax both market forms of ibuprofen that are aimed specifically at those suffering from period pain, while Panadol ActiFast, which is a branded form of paracetamol, claims on the packet to treat tension headaches, period pains and toothache. But Dr Van Tulleken says that once the medicine is absorbed into the bloodstream, there is no way to send it to a particular part of the body. He also reveals that different branded packets all have an identical product licence number, which means they look different but contain exactly the same pills. \u2018It isn\u2019t that the manufacturers are being untruthful, but it is clever marketing to tempt you to spend more money,\u2019 said Dr Van Tulleken. The investigation claims branded painkillers that say they specifically treat certain types of pain are just using \u2018clever marketing\u2019 to make patients spend up to ten times more than they would on unbranded products . PAGB chief executive Matthew Speers told this newspaper: \u2018People search for products to treat their specific symptoms, so different labelling and packaging help people navigate the range more easily. \u2018There are different formulations and formats of over-the-counter medicines, which could mean a painkiller gets to work faster or provides pain relief for longer, even if it has the same active ingredient. \u2018For example, migraine products work faster while back pain products tend to be longer-lasting.\u2019 Dr Van Tulleken says: \u2018Some medicines are a waste of our hard-earned cash. Products may be convenient but not necessarily effective.\u2019 Excess production of the skin pigment melanin can cause blotchy uneven patches of darker skin, known as hyperpigmentation or, more commonly, liver spots. Although harmless, they can be unsightly, appearing most commonly on the backs of the hands. Sun damage is a common cause and pregnancy hormones can also trigger the condition. Two recent pregnancies and many years as a sun-worshipper have left me with blotches of darker skin just above my upper lip, on my cheeks and under my eyes. In the winter I cover them with a foundation, but as summer approaches I\u2019d rather not have to cover up with lots of make up. Where\u2019s the solution? The Bliss Labs active 99.0 anti-ageing facial is on offer at their day spa at South Kensington in London. What\u2019s the treatment? The 75-minute facial promises to firm, smooth and reduce the appearance of fine lines as well as helping to reduce the discoloration caused by hyperpigmentation. The therapist begins by cleansing my skin with an exfoliating powder cleanser. She then gets started with the microdermabrasion machine, which works like a mini-hoover to suck up the dead skin cells, and applies a glycolic peel which targets the hyperpigmentation by breaking apart the dead, damaged cells and peeling away the dark marks. After this she applies a serum, which contains kojic acid (this helps to reduce the appearance of dark spots and discoloration and even out the skin tone) and niacinamide, a form of Vitamin B which can even out skin tone. She then uses a wand attached to a micro-current machine to deliver tiny electrical impulses which enhance the penetration of the active ingredients in the serum. The micro-currents also have an anti-ageing effect by increasing blood and lymph circulation and boosting the production of collagen and elastin. The therapist follows up by applying an eye cream to help diminish puffiness and dark circles. She then applies an intensive moisturiser which contains glycolic acid (known to help fade the effects of hyperpigmentation), and finishes off by applying an SPF 30 to the face \u2013 important as microdermabrasion can increase the skin\u2019s photosensitivity for two weeks. Does it work? My skin felt fresher and clearer and its tone was brighter and more even. This was the perfect preparation for scaling down my make up routine as the summer approaches.

Brian Karl Brimager, 37, entered his plea on Friday after he was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego, in connection with the death of Yvonne Lee Baldelli. He has been in custody since June 2013 on charges including obstruction of justice and falsifying records related to the investigation.

Brian Karl Brimager, 37, was indicted by a federal grand jury in San Diego, in connection with the death of Yvonne Lee Baldelli . The 42-year-old woman from Laguna Niguel, California, was last seen in September 2011 when she arrived in Panama with Brimager. Her family reported her missing the following January . The indictment alleges that Brimager murdered Baldelli, dismembered her body and disposed of her body parts in a remote jungle area. Brimager then engaged in an elaborate scheme to cover up the crime, including destroying evidence and sending a series of emails purportedly from Baldelli in order to make it appear to her friends and family that she was still alive, according to court papers. The indictment also alleges that Brimager attempted to conceal his crime by disposing of a bloody mattress involved in Badelli's murder in the ocean. Brimager conducted two Internet searches on Baldelli's computer, one for 'washing mattress' and a second for 'washing mattress blood stain,' according to documents. A man who was cutting bushes on the island province of Bocas del Toro found a bag containing Baldelli's remains in August 2013. Baldelli's family has the clothing designer was frequently out of touch so they did not immediately suspect anything was wrong. Panama police say Brimager left Panama for Costa Rica and the United States about 10 days after last being seen with Baldelli. In 2012\u00a0FBI agents and Panamanian forensic specialists found traces of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, which is the popular tourist spot where Baldelli was last seen.

    "source": "(CNN)Much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today, enamored by the Duchess of Cambridge's very being, I was similarly captivated by Diana, Princess of Wales when I was a youngster. She was a rare breed: stunningly beautiful, immediately accessible, witty, charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million. Of course that was long before the, \"there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,\" interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal, but back then I was unaware of her more scandalous infamy. I simply adored her ... I still do. As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate. Girls' names are causing the biggest stir, as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess. If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years. The birth of any baby is cause for celebration, but given recent changes in the laws of succession, her arrival would be a historical one. In choosing a name, titled royals tend to turn to the family tree, rather than a well-thumbed copy of \"1,001 Best Baby Names\" like the rest of us. Traditionally they pick dynastic names, and there are plenty to choose from: Elizabeth, Alice, Victoria and Charlotte have all been frontrunners, but the sentimental favorite among punters remains Diana. In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice. That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana. Today Diana's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself: while some have virtually sainted her, others have been vehemently critical, accusing her of being childish, unhinged and self-serving. Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy. In the years since Earl Spencer's scathing attack on the Windsors at Diana's funeral, the nation has moved on and Diana's legacy has been celebrated. She has become a part of royal history. Her memory has been preserved, and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity. Out of respect to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and the baby herself the couple simply wouldn't do it. Diana's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over, and whichever side of the fence you're on, the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry. Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion. He has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes. At his wedding in 2011 the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, a close friend of Diana and executor of her will, gave the address. The hymn Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was sung at both Diana's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007, was chosen for the royal wedding. Julia Samuel, another close friend of Diana, was asked to serve as Godmother to Prince George. William chose Kensington Palace, his own childhood home, to be the primary residence for his family, and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother's memory, he gave Kate Diana's engagement ring. William doesn't need to name his second-born child after his mother in order to honour her; he does so by being a good husband and father. I still miss Diana. She was a one-off, and I don't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her. Daily comparisons to her late mother-in-law are already Kate's cross to bear. Shouldn't a baby girl be spared the same fate? Diana's tragic, untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come. She wouldn't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow. She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.",

    "source": "They may look like inventions straight out of a sci-fi film, but this collection of designs were very much real and developed in a top-secret British war lab more than 70 years ago. Ministry of Defence 1, also known as \u2018Churchill\u2019s Toyshop\u2019, was a  weapons laboratory set up in 1939 by Winston Churchill - a firm believer in the importance of science and technology in warfare. He encouraged his scientists to trial even the most absurd of inventions - many of which never made it beyond the drawing board - but some were so successful that they played a vital role in ending World War Two. Scroll down for video . Winston Churcill is pictured gives his 'victory' sign as, wearing his famed Curchillian hat, he made a polling day tour of his constituency during the election in 1945. Churchill was the Conservative candidate for Woodford, Essex, but lost in the elections . 1. THE PANJANDRUM: A GIANT WHEEL COVERED IN ROCKETS . The Atlantic Wall was a series of robust fortifications built after 1942 by the Nazis to defend against an anticipated Allied invasion. Churchill was born in Blenheim Palace into the blue-blooded dynasty of the Dukes of Marlborough. He was an enthusiastic soldier, fighting in several wars before entering politics. Churchill was made prime minister of Britain in May 1940. He survived several strokes in later life, and on his death, he had one of the largest state funerals in history. It posed a significant obstacle for Allies, and so a potential solution to create a breach large enough to allow a vehicle through was dreamed up by one of Churchill\u2019s military think-tanks. The panjandrum was an unlikely-looking weapon, made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle. Cordite rockets were to propel it at predicted speeds of up to 60 miles (97km) per hour, which even without the deadly force of the explosives it carried, was pretty terrifying considering it weighed around 4,000lbs (1,800kg). After extensive trials, the prototype had a disastrous final test in which it veered dangerously off course and disintegrated in the sea. It was promptly canned. The panjandrum, pictured, was an unlikely-looking weapon, made up of two large wooden cartwheels with a ton of explosives sandwiched between them inside the axle . 2. THE TIME PENCIL: A HIDDEN DETONATOR WITH SIGHTS ON THE FUHRER . Otherwise known as \u2018pencil detonators\u2019 or officially as \u2018Switch, Number 10, Delay\u2019, these were pencil-shaped timed fuses with a vial of corrosive copper chloride at one end. They were inserted into explosives and used as a 'time delay' to set off a bomb. They could be set to delay for between 10 minutes and 24 hours. To activate it, the vial was crushed so the copper chloride would begin to dissolve a metal wire. Once the wire snapped, it released a spring that propelled a striker down the hollow tube to the percussion cap, to detonate the explosives it had been inserted into. These were used extensively during covert operations by the SAS in Africa. One of these detonators was used in the 20 July plot of 1944, in the briefcase-bomb attempt to kill Hitler. This hidden detonator used a vial of corrosive copper to dissolve a metal wire, propelling a 'striker' down a hollow tube and detonating explosives the pencil was attached to . 3. THE LIMPET MINE: LIKE A SEA MINE, BUT WITH A MAN ATTACHED . The idea of using a human torpedo to attach explosive charges had been around since the end of World War One. Churchill\u2019s version was attached by frogmen who used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs (two kilograms) of explosive to an enemy ship, capable of punching a large hole in the hull. Divers would carry the limpet mines underwater and attach them to ships, causing devastating damage when they exploded. They were used in the war to devastating effect. Seven Japanese ships were sunk or disabled by Allied commandos alone, using limpet mines in Singapore Harbour, 1943. Churchill\u2019s 'human torpedo' used the most powerful magnet in the world at the time to attach around 4.5lbs (two kilograms) of explosive to an enemy ship, capable of punching a large hole in the hull . You can read more about Winston Churchill's 'mad science'  in issue 22 of All About History . 4. PROJECT HABBAKUK: A GIANT ICEBERG AIRCRAFT CARRIER . Steel and aluminium were at a premium during the war, so when inventor Geoffrey Pyke, who worked at Combined Operation Headquarters (COHQ), was considering a way of protecting Atlantic convoys beyond the reach of aircraft cover, he realised the answer was ice. Specifically, he considered creating huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway. The problem was that icebergs tend to roll over, so Pyke\u2019s answer was a combination of wood pulp and ice, which he called \u2018pykrete\u2019. This wouldn\u2019t sink, was much stronger than ice and wouldn\u2019t shatter, so it could easily be carved into shape. However, it never came into being. Pyke encountered a series of engineering problems that ultimately required the use of some steel in Habbakuk. Plus, the invention of long-range aircraft fuel tanks and the use of airfields in the Azores made it redundant. Geoffrey Pyke's radical idea was to build\u00a0huge flotillas carved out of icebergs that could house aircraft and provide a runway - although they never came into being . 5. THE STICKY BOMB:\u00a0A DEADLY EXPLOSIVE YOU (SOMETIMES) CAN\u2019T OUTRUN . This was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs (half a kilogram) of nitroglycerine, covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal. Its handle contained a five-second fuse and a safety pin that, upon being pulled, released the metal casing and exposed the adhesive. The adhesive was added to allow the bomb to remain attached to an enemy tank for the few seconds of delay before the bomb exploded. In theory, the sticky bomb could be attached to a passing tank, although in practice tanks often proved too dirty or wet for the bombs to stick. Despite this, 2.5 million were made and used between 1940 and 1943. The Stick Bomb is shown being assembled in 1943.\u00a0This was a kind of grenade consisting of a glass sphere filled with more than 1.5lbs (half a kilogram) of nitroglycerine, covered with an extremely sticky adhesive and encased in metal . 6. ARTIFICIAL HARBOURS: A POP-UP INVASION AID TO BRING THE TANKS ASHORE . \u2018Mulberries\u2019, or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known, were portable, temporary harbours designed specifically in World War Two to help the Allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large-scale invasion. In the years leading up to the D-Day landings, it had become apparent that any attempt to land en masse on the Atlantic coastline of Western Europe would require the use of the French harbours. And to do that, the Allies would need to depend on penetrating the Nazi Atlantic Wall, which could not be done. Instead, the Mulberries were to be transported and assembled off the French coast, providing mobile port facilities including cranes, roads and piers. \u2018Mulberry A\u2019 and \u2018Mulberry B\u2019 were successfully used for the invasion of Normandy in June 1944. The American Mulberry A was destroyed by storms but the British Mulberry B served for six months after D-Day before being decommissioned. \u2018Mulberries\u2019 (one pictured), or artificial harbours as they were otherwise known, were portable, temporary harbours designed specifically in World War Two to help the Allies unload the heavy cargoes associated with a large-scale invasion . 7. THE PIAT: A ONE-MAN ARTILLERY BARRAGE (WHEN IT HIT ANYTHING) By the middle of World War Two enemy tanks had become increasingly well armoured, to the point that they were impenetrable to the outdated infantry grenade launchers. The Projector, Infantry, Anti-Tank (PIAT) was a portable mortar system that used a powerful spring to arm and launch a  bomb weighing 2.5lbs (1.1kg)\u00a0with a shaped charge up to 360ft (110 metres) away. They were first issued to British forces in 1943 and used throughout the war by the Allies. Although not entirely reliable, they were quite capable of taking out enemy tanks when they hit their targets and detonated.

    "source": "Judd Trump was in confident mood after safely moving through to the second round of the Betfred World Championship in Sheffield. Trump led 7-2 overnight and many thought he would make light work of Stuart Carrington but he was made to battle before eventually securing a 10-6 victory. The 25-year-old closed with a century and will now face Marco Fu in the next round. Judd Trump beat Stuart Carrington 10-6 on Thursday in the first round of the World Championship . 'I'm just going to focus on my own game,' he told BBC Two. 'If I play how I know I can, I'll win it.' A re-rack was required in the 10th frame but that did not distract Carrington who produced a break of 97 to reduce the gap to four. Trump took the next with a streak of 74 but a 74 of his own from Carrington followed by a run of 70 in the next meant it was 8-5 at the interval. Carrington got amongst the balls after the interval but was halted at 24 and Trump swept in with a 76 to move within one frame of victory. Grimsby potter Carrington showed his mettle, though, with a 99 in the next before a closing 109 from Trump put an end to his campaign. And the 2011 finalist was quick to praise his opponent, who was making his Crucible debut. Trump (pictured) led 7-2 from Wednesday and got the job done despite a good display by Carrington . 'He played really well considering it's his first time here,' he said. 'Second session he hardly missed a ball. He probably won't take as much credit as he would if it was a top player making those breaks. 'He played as good as anyone I've seen first time here.' Trump is one of the crowd favourites wherever he plays and admits there is a weight of expectation on him this year. 'There's obviously a lot of anticipation this year,' he added. 'My results have shown that I'm playing some good stuff, I felt like I played well over the past two days. 'There's obviously a few things I need to work on but other than that I feel very confident. 'It was nice for Stuart to play as he did, it just shows there is always stuff to work on and you won't get many sessions where someone plays that well.' After being five frames behind, Carrington closed the gap to three before Trump earned the victory . At the press conference following his win, Trump was asked about the footwear problems encountered by long-time rival Ronnie O'Sullivan, whose 10-3 victory over Craig Steadman required a change of shoes. Having started Tuesday's match in a new pair of shoes, O'Sullivan discarded them due to the acute discomfort they were causing him; he briefly played in socks before accepting tournament director Mike Ganley's shoes which 'felt great' to him. Of the incident, Trump said: 'I didn't really see it but I heard about it. Obviously, he likes attention. I don't know if he's done it on purpose or not, who knows?' As to the overall favourite for the World Championship, Trump was quick to divert attention away from O'Sullivan, adding: 'In my eyes, I think Neil's (Robertson) probably the underdog, . Ronnie O'Sullivan was forced into borrowing a pair of shoes from\u00a0tournament director Mike Ganley . 'I think Neil's favourite to win the tournament. Neil and Mark (Selby) are going to be the toughest two. Ronnie is obviously a good player but I'm confident of beating anyone.' On the other table, defending champion Mark Selby was locked in a tough battle with Anthony McGill in the opening second round match. Selby, who needed to scrap for a 10-9 win over Kurt Maflin in the first round, got off to a slow start as he surrendered the first two frames. The first was a scrappy encounter but a break of 63 sealed the second for McGill before runs of 51 and 46 saw Selby on the board. The Leicester cueman then levelled things up at the mid-session interval with a 65 and an 87 at the third time of asking saw him edge ahead. Defending champion Mark Selby closed the session at 4-4 with\u00a0Anthony McGill in their second round match . McGill was not daunted, though, and breaks of 74 and 73 in the next two saw him take a 4-3 lead before Selby drew level again to end the session at 4-4. Shaun Murphy, the 2005 world champion and current Masters title holder, conceded just the one additional frame to his overnight lead of 7-2 as he wrapped up a 10-3 win over Robin Hull. Murphy's first frame on Thursday was a tight affair at 56-55 and he went on to win the next 64-33. Finland's Hull was able to pick up frame 12 but Murphy's wrapped up the contest with a break of 111. It sealed his passage to the second round where he will meet Joe Perry, who had beaten Zhang Anda 10-4. Shaun Murphy wrapped up victory against Finland's Robin Hull with a 10-3 win on Thursday . Ding Junhui has a chance of progressing past John Higgins after his break of 94 sealed frame eight to leave the Chinese 5-3 down going into Friday's session. Higgins had picked up back-to-back frames at the start without much fuss, including 81 on the first, though Ding's class showed in a 135 break in the third. Four-time World Championship winner Higgins then threatened to walk away with the match by winning three frames on the bounce, starting with 116-6 in the fourth and going on to lead 5-1. However, Ding fought back in the closing stages to narrow the deficit, though he did miss out on a second century break of the match after failing to pot the black, on what was to prove the last shot of the day.",

    "source": "Their parents came to the U.S. for opportunities and now these four teens have them in abundance. The high-achieving high schoolers  have each been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University. And as well as the Ivy League colleges, each of them has also been accepted to other top schools. While they all grew up in different cities, the students are the offspring of immigrant parents who moved to America - from Bulgaria, Somalia or Nigeria. And all four - Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana,\u00a0Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and\u00a0Harold Ekeh from New York - say they have their parents' hard work to thank. Now they hope to use the opportunities for good - whether its effecting positive social change, improving education across the world or becoming a neurosurgeon. The teens have one more thing in common: they don't know which school they're going to pick yet. The daughter of Somali immigrants who has already received a U.N. award and wants to improve education across the world . Star pupil:\u00a0Munira Khalif, from St. Paul, Minnesota, says she has always been driven by the thought that her parents, who left Somalia during the civil war, fled to the U.S. so she would have better opportunities . Munira Khalif, who attends Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, was shocked when she was accepted by eight Ivy Schools and three others - but her teachers were not. 'She is composed and she is just articulate all the time,' Randy Comfort, an upper school director at the private school, told\u00a0KMSP. 'She's pretty remarkable.' The 18-year-old student, who was born and raised in Minnesota after her parents fled Somalia during the civil war, she said she was inspired to work hard because of the opportunities her family and the U.S. had given her. 'The thing is, when you come here as an immigrant, you're hoping to have opportunities not only for yourself, but for your kids,' she told the channel. 'And that's always been at the back of my mind.' As well as achieving top grades, Khalif has immersed herself in other activities both in and out of school - particularly those aimed at doing good. She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13. Incredible: Munira, pictured speaking at Malala Day at the UN, hopes to study political science at college . High achiever:\u00a0She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13 . She launched a non-profit group, Lighting the Way, to make education more accessible for East African youth, especially girls, through scholarships, libraries and improving sanitation issues. And she was also appointed as A World at School Global Youth Ambassador to promote universal education. Khalif, who plans to study political science at college, said she has yet to decide where to go and plans to visit a few more campuses before she makes her final decision. As well as the Ivy League schools, she also received offers from Stanford, Georgetown and the University of Minnesota - and she's still letting the realization sink in. 'I was very surprised,' she said. 'I am humbled to even have the opportunity to choose amongst these schools because they are all incredible places to learn and grow.' The Bulgarian housekeeper's son who couldn't speak English a decade before he was accepted to 18 top schools in the U.S. Driven: Stefan Stoykov cried on his first day of school because he could not speak a word of English but he is now a straight-A student committed to helping other pupils with language barriers . When eight-year-old Stefan Stoykov moved from his family's one-bedroom apartment in Bulgaria to the U.S. after his parents won a green card lottery, he could not speak a word of English. 'I started crying on the first day of class,' Stefan recalled of his first day in the second grade. 'I was scared. I was scared. I didn't understand what was going on around me.' But now 18 and a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools in the world - and he admits he can hardly believe it. 'It is an incredible feeling,' Stefan told WTHR. 'I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. 'I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' But as well as getting offers from all Ivy League schools, 10 other prestigious institutions also came knocking. He has yet to decide where he will go. He revealed that hard work and the support of his mother, a housekeeper, had helped him achieve his goals. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., his parents divorced and his father took a job as a truck driver, and he has not seen him much since. Impressive: Despite his early struggles at school, he said he knew that he had to make the most of the opportunities he had been given by his parents when they moved him from Bulgaria to the U.S. 'My parents had done so much to put me in this position, to put me in the United States of America,' he said. 'And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include tutoring other students with language barriers, running the cycling club and Spirit Week and joining the stock market club, the Indy Star reported. He is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score by borrowing test guides from the library. He also helps his mother - who spent much of his childhood working so that she could support him - with her housekeeping duties so that it takes her half the time. The son of a Nigerian immigrant who dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon . Hard worker:\u00a0Victor Agbafe, 17, says he believes his Nigerian immigrant mother set a good example for him in her job as a physician. He now hopes to study\u00a0microbiology  with government or economics . Victor Agbafe, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, North Carolina, has no idea where he will attend college, but he's certain on one thing: he wants to become a neurosurgeon. The 17-year-old was accepted to 14 schools in total, including all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford and Duke. Agbafe, who plans to double major in microbiology along with government or economics, called his acceptance achievement an 'amazing opportunity', WSOC reported. Just before he played a game for his school's basketball team, he learned that Harvard had made a decision about his application - but he waited until the game was over to find out. 'I owed it my teammates to be focused there,' he said. 'I didn't want to get too low on myself if I didn't get in. I also didn't want to get too high if I was accepted.' Going places: The teenager from Wilmington, North Carolina says he plans to visit as many campuses as he can before he makes his final decision by May 1. He hopes to become a neurosurgeon . He has also been part of North Carolina's Youth and Government program, where he was chosen as Speaker of the House. He says his mother, a Nigerian immigrant and physician, set a good example for him - but she refuses to take the credit. 'For God to crown his effort with success is just something that is just beyond me,' his mother Dorothy Agbafe-Mosley said. 'I am very happy that he has all these choices to make. But then it also makes it difficult because it's a lot of good schools. A lot of good schools.' Her son will make a decision later this month after visiting as many campuses as possible. The Nigerian student who credits his Target employee parents with his success . Top student: Harold Ekeh, from Long Island, New York, has been accepted to 14 colleges in total . Ten years after his family moved him from Nigeria to the U.S., Harold Ekeh is hoping to do something for them in return. The 18-year-old Long Islander was accepted by 14 colleges - including all Ivy League schools - and now hopes to study neuroscience to cure Alzheimer's, the disease his grandmother suffers from. The straight-A student at Elmont Memorial High School secured an SAT score of 2270. He also worked as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. But he wasn't expecting to get into so many top schools.\u00a0As well as offers from the Ivy League colleges, he was also accepted by Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. 'It was crazy,' he told DailyMail.com. 'My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it.' Afterwards 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect,' he said. Devoted: He hopes to study neuroscience and find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandmother suffers from . He said it was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country,' he said. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' He said he is leaning towards going to Yale but will be visiting a few more campuses before making his decision before May 1.",

His capabilities have even earned him special appearances and sponsorship deals with fans desperate to hear his bass-heavy house music. Two-year-old Oratilwe Hlongwane, from Johannesburg, South Africa, whose DJ name is AJ, is still learning to put together words but is already able to play music from a laptop, making him a worldwide phenomenon . The youngster, who still wears nappies and does not yet go to school, plays bass-heavy house music on DJ decks after teaching himself how to select and play music with an disc jockey app on his father's iPad . His capabilities have earned him special appearances and sponsorship deals with fans desperate to hear him . His recent performance at a shopping mall in his home of Johannesburg gathered a large crowd as he bopped his head to the beat, with large headphones slung around his neck. His mother, Refiloe Marumo, credits his astounding success on the decks to his father Glen Hlongwane's decision to buy an iPad for his then unborn son. Mr Hlongwane, a gymnastics coach and aspiring DJ, had planned to download educational apps to speed up his child's education but also downloaded a disc jockeying app for himself. When he was just one-year-old, little Oratilwe learned how to use the gadget and started fiddling about with his father's DJ app. His parents were blown away when their son, who still wears nappies, repeated what he had learned on the app on actual DJ equipment, playing with sound effects and bouncing between songs. A mobile phone recording of him playing music was shared online and the youngster now has nearly 25,000 Facebook fans.

However, as well as a legion of fans, his newfound fame has also brought criticism, with some people accusing his parents of abuse and profiting from their child's precocious ability. Mr Hlongwane said he would not 'exploit his kid' and said the youngster wasn't allowed to play in clubs or at parties due to his age. His parents also insisted that they will not force their son to be a DJ when he grows up, but say they believe his affinity for electronic equipment will probably decide his future.

The Irishman makes the first defence of his WBO middleweight belt against Peter Quillin in New York on Saturday. And he is confident he is ready for anything the former champion has in his locker. Andy Lee works out with trainer Adam Booth at the Barclays Centre ahead of his fight against Peter Quillin . Lee is making the first defence of the WBO middleweight title he won against Matt Korobov last year . 'We've made unbelievable progress in the last year on my skills and everything has really just clicked for me and my team and now we're seeing the results in the ring,' Lee said. 'I'm very proud to be an Irishman from Limerick defending his world championship in New York, it doesn't get much better than that. 'There's been a huge weight lifted off my shoulders since winning the world title. It's what I always wanted to do and I've been touted as a champion for years and if I never got it I would have been disappointed. Now the monkey is off my back and I can just box and show people who I am. 'We've made physical and tactical improvements in the gym since the last fight and hopefully they'll show up in the ring on Saturday. 'I think this could be a technical fight or it could be a bit of a fire fight. It's going to be a little of both at times. There will be moments where we're looking at each other, figuring each other out, but once we exchange it could be explosive. 'Quillin is sure of himself, but he has to be, I have the same mentality. You have to be to compete in this sport. 'Fighting at home like Quillin is on Saturday, brings a different kind of pressure to the table, it's the pressure of expectations and people you know coming to the fights. That's also pressure and I know all about that. Quillin is a former champion but is yet to taste defeat as a professional and poses a tough challenge for Lee . Quillin says he has faced struggles his whole life and that this fight will just be the latest in a long line . 'I haven't needed to build up my confidence for this fight. It's not time to think. It's time to do what I've been doing every day in the gym.' Quillin, meanwhile, believes the fight will just be another struggle he has to overcome. 'I never trailed in a fight and came back and won like Lee. I've just won all the time right out of the gate. Those other guys aren't 'Kid Chocolate' so I think that's why this fight was made,' he said. 'It's a big fight for him and a big fight for me. He's a smart fighter when he's in trouble so I have to watch out for that. Most importantly I just need to be true to myself. 'A lot of people had Lee as the underdog in his last fight but he came out and did great. That's the thing about boxing; one punch can change the fight. 'I'm getting paid for 12 rounds so I'm preparing for 12 rounds but if I can get him out of there early I will. 'My whole life has been struggles and I've had to overcome every single one of those struggles. This is going to be no different from that. 'Being a father of course made me more inspired and watching my uncle pass has made me more motivated than ever to accomplish everything I want. 'When I gave up the belt I learned that I can be a bigger man and make tough decisions like that all of the time. People think losing is easy, but winning all the time is a different kind of pressure.'",

    "source": "(CNN)Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was once known as the murder capital of the world. Back in 2010, at the height of cartel violence, the city averaged 8.5 killings per day. But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez. This month the city launched the tourism campaign \"Juarez is Waiting for You.\" The rebranding effort started quietly a year ago, and on April 10, it was on full display. Mayor Enrique Serrano officially kicked off the campaign, giving what he called an \"unprecedented\" high-profile tour to regional leaders from the United States and Mexico. U.S. Rep. Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour. His congressional district includes El Paso, Texas, which sits directly across the Rio Grande. O'Rourke says there's good reason for locals to be hopeful. \"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade. The binational ties are strong and have remained strong,\" O'Rourke says. \"Yes, we had a really difficult time for a ... period. Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world.\" O'Rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men, women and children were killed indiscriminately. Many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence. Others were victims of the drug turf war. It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez. \"(Now) I travel to Juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go. I always feel safe and secure.\" A spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN that at one point, there were days when Juarez had more than 20 killings. \"That was normal,\" spokesman Julio Castaneda told CNN. \"It's safer now.\" The numbers from the attorney general's office seem to bear that out. More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence. \"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped. There was a coordinated effort between agencies,\" Castaneda said. \"Without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city.\" The government cleaned up corruption within the local police force, and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels. Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez. O'Rourke argues that the El Paso-Juarez border is \"safer than it's ever been.\" He cites the \"30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez\" last year as a symbolic step. Yet there are those who don't want to celebrate too soon. \"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go,\" says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life. \"Just this past year (in 2014) there were 424 homicides. In 2007, there were 272. Yes, we're not as bad. But we're still very sick,\" Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez. \"In reality, we're progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity. We're still working out the corruption in the city. It's still an issue here.\" With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on \"the people's participation in public matters.\" In fact, the organization's slogan is \"Nothing is fixed alone. Participate.\" \"We are looking at a compromised future,\" Meza said. \"We don't talk about that. We don't have the money to generate work here.\" One bright spot: U.S. investment is making a comeback. American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year. That hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago. But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done. The scars from the recent past remain. Several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti. Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence. But in a sign of progress, the U.S. State Department amended its travel warning for the city. While it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution, it's no longer telling people not to come. Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed. In the last year, however, they have definitely noticed that \"life is back.\" \"I measure it by the everyday coming and going of people,\" Gustavo Reveles, 39, told CNN. \"For someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis, it's encouraging to be crossing back to Juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen.\" Reveles lived in Juarez until he was 15 and now lives in El Paso. He says the threat of violence is \"still a little bit concerning,\" though that hasn't stopped him in recent weeks from going to Juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks. \"Things have changed,\" he said. \"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again. You see a semblance of what was there before. To really recover and heal wounds, there's a long way to go, but the process has started and that's a step in the right direction.\" CNNMoney's Octavio Blanco contributed to this report.",

    "source": "Audi has created a so-called 'green' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide. The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide.\u00a0Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long\u2011distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800\u00b0C (1,472\u00b0F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.' The new fuel was developed by Audi along with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam, which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800\u00b0C (1,472\u00b0F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature.

Hydrogen is  pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings \u2013 known as aromatic hydrocarbons \u2013 which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the  oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane \u2013 for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the \"green economy\" in place.'",

Owner Wendy Stokes, 74, had given up hope of ever seeing Toby again after he escaped from her garden 11 months ago. But he has now returned home and after piecing together his escapades over the last year, it's become apparent he's had quite an adventure. Reunited: Wendy Stokes, 74, is delighted to have 109-year-old Toby back after his escape 11 months ago . He wandered through a gate in her garden and headed for the open road where he was picked up by a passing driver concerned for his safety and taken to a nearby animal rescue centre. Six months ago, he was re-homed with a couple living in Margate, Kent, 22 miles away from Wendy's farm in West Hougham. But the couple, who could just about make out the word 'Stokes' written in white paint on his shell, felt they needed to find out who Tony belonged to. With nothing else to go on, they decided to call every Stokes in Kent listed in the phonebook. Eventually came across a delighted Wendy, who immediately arranged to collect him. She's had Toby since the 1980s when he was given to her by her late great aunt. He was returned home last Sunday, a full 11 months after his amazing, if a little slow, adventure. Wendy has had Toby since the 1980s and wrote her surname, Stokes, on his back in white paint . Retired farm worker Wendy said: 'I had painted my name and number on the side of his shell but it had faded when he went missing so they couldn't read it. 'The people who found him could read Stokes but they couldn't make out the number. 'He had got out because I had left my gate open. It is normally closed because we have sheep in the paddock but they were in a different field. 'Toby just walked out and trotted towards the road where somebody picked him up and took him to a rescue centre. 'Everyone knows I have a tortoise and we always take him to the village fete so he is a bit of a local celebrity. 'I was devastated when he went missing and spent weeks looking for him in all the fields around the farm.' She added: 'I went all goosey when they told me they had Toby because I had really given up on him. 'It is brilliant having him back and I think everybody was keeping their eye out for him all this time.'",

The current project has been ongoing for six years with researchers taking a tiny part of shoulder bone and analysing it in the lab. It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck. Altamura is a city of Apulia, in southern Italy.\u00a0It is believed that Altamura Man was left in such a peculiar spot after falling in a well and getting stuck . Researchers have, up until now, held off from excavating the remains as they believed it would cause irreparable to the skeleton. An earlier study of the head and part of a shoulder of suggested the skeleton belong to a Neanderthal. Pictured is\u00a0\u2018Altamura Man's\u2019 skull from different angles . Scientists assume he starved to death, or died from lack of water - but not much else is known about his life. Analysis revealed that the calcite on skull was formed 172,000 to 130,000 years ago, during a period when ice sheets were expanding significantly from out of Antarctica and Greenland. The team say samples of DNA have also been retrieved from the sample, and because of the age, represent the oldest such samples ever recovered from Neanderthal remains. It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly two per cent Neanderthal DNA. These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our HLA system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from Neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 Diabetes because they interbred with Neanderthals. Researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities have also found that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer were present in the Neanderthal genome. If they manage to sequence the DNA, they hope it might reveal new details about the evolution of hominids in general and the early history of the Neanderthal. Separate research earlier this week found that Neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today - and this may be what killed them off. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from Cambridge University and Oxford Brookes University say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of Neanderthals. Neanderthals are thought to have numbered up to 70,000 at their peak and lived in hunter gatherer societies .",

The 25-ft long wreckage was discovered floating west of Ona Beach in Lincoln County at about 9.30am on Thursday. Biologists with the Oregon Coast Aquarium and Oregon State University's Hatfield Marine Science Center inspected the boat remains and and found 'several live specimens of a variety of yellowtail jack fish found in the coastal waters of Japan.' Tsunami debris: A chunk of a fiberglass boat 25-30' long has been spotted floating off the Oregon shore . Rescued: These live yellowtail jack fish, native to Japan, were found inside the floating debris and are now being housed in the Oregon Coast Aquarium . The several live yellowtail jack fish found on board will be delivered to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Five million tons of wreckage - the remains of homes, boats, and other remnants of shattered lives in eastern Japan - were swallowed by the ocean when the tsunami struck four years ago. About 70 per cent of it sank, leaving about 1.5 million tons floating with scientists saying they expect more debris to hit Alaska and the West Coast of North America for years to come. An estimated 5 million tons of debris washed into the ocean in March of 2011 during the tsunami. Around 70 percent of it is believed to have immediately sunk near the Japanese coast. Some more mobile items may have reached the Pacific Northwest before 2011 even came to a close. The first documented piece of debris to arrive in California, a barnacle covered fishing boat, came ashore in April 2013. The particles are dispersed sparsely from Alaska to the Philippines. In 2013, a floating island of debris the size of Texas crossed the vast Pacific Ocean to the western shores of the Americas. The Oregan authorities plan to tow the boat segment to the Port of Newport for temporary storage. 'The debris appears to be half to two-thirds of a larger vessel, possibly damaged and set adrift during the earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan in 2011,' said\u00a0Chris Havel of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department. He said biologists inspected the object and consulted with the state Fish and Wildlife Department, deciding that the attached organisms pose little threat to the Oregon coast ecosystem.

The New York Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident after the footage was posted online involving Detective Patrick Cherry. One of the passengers in the car captured the exchange after the incident in West Village. Scroll down for video . Detective Patrick Cherry, pictured in the blue shirt, launched his tirade after the Uber driver hooted at him . The driver, named only as Humayun, pictured, tried to repeatedly apologise to Detective Cherry . The officer has been named by the New York Daily News\u00a0as Detective Patrick Cherry of the NYPD's joint terrorism task force. Detective Cherry was trying to park his Hyundai without indicating when the Uber driver known only as\u00a0Humayun honked his horn. The angered detective pulled over the Uber cab and launched a tirade, questioning the diver's command of the English language as well as his car control skills. Detective Cherry is now under investigation by the Civilian Complaint Review Board following a complaint of 'discourtesy'. President of the Detectives Endowment Association said Detective Cherry had been visiting his colleague Detective Harry Hill who had recently had a heart attack while undergoing surgery and was very stressed. He said: 'The past five days have been emotionally draining for the members of the JTTF dealing with their fellow detective's health . 'Despite what some people think, cops have feelings, too.' During the three-minute video, Detective Cherry shouts: 'I don't know where you're coming from, where you think you're appropriate in doing that; that's not the way it works. How long have you been in this country?' The two passengers in the backseat of the car can be heard assuring the driver that he has done nothing wrong, with one of them saying; 'It's not your fault; this guy's just a d***.' Moments later the cop returns with a ticket, this after he has pounded on the car and, according to one of the passengers, thrown things in the vehicle. As the driver agrees with everything the cop says, he manages to cut off the man, which sends him into another tirade as he screams; 'I don't know what f****** planet you're on right now!' The officer also mocks the driver's accent throughout and his pronunciation of certain words. Passengers in the cab claimed that Detective Cherry failed to indicate before attempting to park his Hyundai . According to the New York Daily News, the NYPD has seen the video and said in a statement; 'We are aware of the incident and video and it is under review with the department\u2019s Internal Affairs Bureau.' 'Our Uber driver, Humayun, was abused by a police officer today in New York,' Sanjay Seth, who took the video, wrote on his Facebook page on Monday. 'The unending rage, door slamming, throwing items into the car, threatening arrest without cause was bad enough - but the officer's remarks at the end really took it to another level.' Uber said in a statement; 'The behavior in the video is wrong and unacceptable and we appreciate the NYPD investigating the incident. We are in touch with our driver-partner who was subjected to this terrible experience and will continue to provide any support he needs.'",

Ten years ago, bartender Liz Clark did just that when she swapped cleaning glasses for sailing around the world . The 34-year-old promised to document her travels on a Cal 40 sailboat after being handed inspiration from a retired professor . And for the last decade Liz has been enjoying an idyllic life as she sails alone in a sailboat, travelling about 25,000 nautical miles to date. 'After I graduated from university, I happened to cross paths with a retired professor, Dr. Arent H. Schuyler, who was looking for someone to sail his boat around the world,' says Liz. 'He was 80 years old at the time and just wanted to help someone else realize his dream.' Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance. She says: 'At university I learned about all the damage we were doing to the Earth and the unsustainable lifestyles we were leading. 'I looked around me and it seemed like no one was doing anything about it, and I decided that I really didn't want to be a part of it anymore.

Liz, who studied Environmental Studies at the University of California in Santa Barbara, jumped at the chance to discover the world . As well as perfect her sailing skills, the ten-year trip has helped Liz perfect her surf-boarding talents . Sailing around the world offers Liz the perfect chance for scenic stop-offs to practise yoga . After graduating from university, Liz worked as a bartender for three years, before quitting her job when the opportunity to sail around the world arose. She spent three years preparing for her voyage and learning how to operate the sailboat. Liz says: 'It was petrifying to leave the safety and security of the dock and my friends and family.

It's often hard work for Liz, as she is photographed here \u00a0fixing the anchor in the ground to secure her boat in the eastern South Pacific . Liz did make a friend when she visited Tahiti in 2013, and even took the cat on the boat with her . Her travels around the world have given Liz memories to treasure forvever, including enjoying herself with the locals in Panama in 2007 . Setting off in October 2005, Liz has travelled to a number of exotic destinations, including Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and the Galapagos Islands. Liz has documented her travels in a series of envy inducing photographs. She used a timer to take some of the pictures herself, while other photos were taken by locals.

Liz's daily routine includes adjusting sails and boat maintenance, as well as surfing, yoga, swimming and sleeping under the stars. She says: 'People are generally either awed or jealous, others are totally inspired and excited. 'It feels so great to inspire others to live their dreams, but it's impossible to explain to them what this life is really like; how much hard work there is and that it isn't always easy or fun. 'But that's part of living your dreams - it's never easy, but no work is ever as hard when it's part of your dreams and moving you towards your desires.' The journey throws up daily challenges for Liz, shown here as she battles tough weather in the eastern Pacific in 2008 .

'The kindness of strangers wherever I go, along with the remote love and support from family and friends, always fills up that emptiness whenever I feel a void.' In 2011, the man responsible for Liz's adventure, Dr. Schuyler, died, aged 87. Liz says: 'He never wanted to be on the boat. He just wanted to help me live my dream and live vicariously through me. 'That's how my blog originally started, because I wanted him to be able to share my experiences.'

The disgusting symbol of racial hatred is now under investigation by\u00a0Duke University and the police who are attempting to work out who hung the rope on the tree. Police said the thin yellow rope was tied into a noose at about 2 a.m. Wednesday\u00a0on  the Bryan Center plaza in Durham, North Carolina. Disgusting:\u00a0Officials said the rope was tied into a noose at about 2 a.m. in the Bryan Center plaza in Durham North Carolina . The area in which the noose was found is home to several offices focused on diversity including the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity and the Center for Multicultural Affairs. Larry Moneta, Duke's vice president for student affairs said in an email to students that anyone found responsible for 'committing this act of intimidation' would be held accountable. She wrote: 'To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect.' 'Today, fear will be among the reactions students, and especially, students of color, will have. Be assured that the Duke community will provide all the support necessary to help us all get through this. 'In time, each of these cowardly acts of bias and hatred will strengthen our resolve to love and support each other.' Duke University students took to social media sites to discuss the issue, with many believing it was  racially motivated. On twitter, @DPickett12 wrote: 'They're still hanging nooses from trees..... Look how far we've come.' And @Indyz_A_WOW responded: 'Talk about it! They think they can erase this history. Duke has always been racist.' @DPickett12 added: 'Duke hasn't been just diagnosed with racism...it has been suffering from this disease for years. It's chronic.'

Several students were seen talking to two police officers shortly after reports about it surfaced online.

They chanted: 'We are not afraid we stand together,' according to a tweet by Amanda Lamb from WRAL. Students chanted: 'We are not afraid we stand together,' according to a tweet by Amanda Lamb from WRAL . However, the incident comes just two weeks after  students allegedly chanted a racist song at a black female student. The race hate incident led Duke President Richard Brodhead and Provost Sally Kornbluth to send an email to the student body affirming the university's commitment to racial equality. It also spawned the creation of a group called The Duke People of Color Caucus which released a statement on Tumblr along with a photo of the noose. The statement read: 'To all black students, staff, faculty, and/or Durhamites on campus and in the area: Please take care of yourselves and each other. 'This campus is not a safe space, and has proven beyond any doubt that it is a hostile environment for any and all black people.' School spokesman Keith Lawrence said both Duke administrators and the police are now carrying out an investigation. University and student leaders have scheduled a forum for 5 p.m. Wednesday on the steps of Duke Chapel. Speakers will include President Richard Brodhead. Duke has about 15,000 undergraduate and graduate students.\u00a0It costs about $60,000 a year to attend as an undergraduate, including room and board, according to the school's website. About half of all undergraduate students receive financial aid. @cierane tweeted: 'The fact that black students at Duke pay $60,000 a year and constantly feel unsafe on campus is ridiculous.'",

Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid \u2013 yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator \u2013 to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training \u2013 and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own \u2013 to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union \u2013 which represents 44,000 firemen \u2013 said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance. Paramedics did not show up for 40 minutes after which time her pulse had stopped. Last month the Mail revealed how London Ambulance Service had resorted to flying half way round the world to Australia to hire 225 paramedics because it is so overstretched.",

Scroll down for video . A new ComRes poll for ITV News reveals 54 per cent want her kept out of the next UK government, and 59 per cent want the SNP as a whole to play no part in running the country . Nicola  Sturgeon today launched her party's manifesto setting out demands for as the price propping up a Labour government, promising the rest of the UK the 'hand of friendship' Polls in Scotland put the SNP on course to make huge gains north of the border, taking dozens of seats from Labour and robbing Ed Miliband of all hopes of securing an overall majority. Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition with SNP MPs sitting in Cabinet. But they have left open the possibility of the SNP supporting a Labour government on a vote-by-vote basis, raising the prospect of Mr Miliband being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through. The SNP has already suggested that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. It means that for Labour to pass new laws or agree to spending in England, Wales or Northern Ireland they would have to strike a deal with the SNP. With the election too close to call, and polls pointing to another hung parliament, ComRes surveyed voters to see which parties they would like to see sharing power with Labour or the Tories. The SNP got the biggest thumbs down, with 59 per cent against them playing a role in the British government and only 19 per cent in favour. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured campaigning in Chester today, warned an SNP-Labour deal would be a 'match made in hell' for the British economy . 36 per cent of voters back the Lib Dems playing a role in the next government, with only 40 per cent against . The manifesto includes demands for extra spending, an end to benefits cuts and the scrapping of Trident . Key election promises in the SNP manifesto include: . Ms Sturgeon has made clear that in the event of a hung parliament she will take charge of talks with Labour. 'I am the leader of the party, I would lead those\u00a0discussions if we're in that scenario.' she said yesterday. However, just 22 per cent of voters across the UK back the idea with 54 per cent against. It makes the SNP by far the least popular potential coalition partner. Pollsters said older British adults were the most likely to be opposed to SNP influence. An astonishing 71 per cent of those aged 65 and over want to lock Ms Sturgeon out of power, compared to 44 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds. By contrast, 36 per cent of voters back the Lib Dems playing a role in the next government, with only 40 per cent against. Voters are more split on Ukip, with 32 per cent in favour of Nigel Farage entering a power-sharing deal, but 51 per cent opposed. Amid fears of a backlash south of the border, Ms Sturgeon claimed she was offering the 'genuine hand of friendship' to the rest of the UK. She stated: 'The SNP isn't going to Westminster to seek to bring down governments or block budgets. We're going to Westminster to build an alliance for good, positive, progressive, sensible change.' She unveiled her her \u00a3140billion  'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. David Cameron warned any deal with the SNP to put Labour in power would force Mr Miliband to negotiate 'day by day, vote by vote, favour by favour'. This would mean 'endless bargaining and backroom deals' to keep Labour in power - even if it hit English voters in the pocket. Mr Cameron said: 'Every single decision taking the form of a ransom note \u2013 written by the SNP. 'Make no mistake, if Labour and the SNP get into power, you are going to see an alliance between a party that wants to spend, borrow and tax more\u2026with a party that wants to spend, borrow and tax even more. 'It might be a match made in heaven for them but it is a match made in hell for the British economy.' More than half of people do not want Ukip leader Nigel Farage to play a part in the next government, but Lib Dem Nick Clegg proved the most popular with 36 per cent wanting his party back in power . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg today made a fresh pitch to be returned to power in a second coalition. He told ITV's Lorraine: 'I know the Conservatives are playing footsie with Ukip, with this right wing alliance with Ukip, and Labour are playing footsie with the SNP. 'I'm not going to have an alliance, I'm not going to have an arrangement, nor a coalition, with Ukip or the SNP. 'The question is not is Ed Miliband or David Cameron, are one of those two going into Number 10, it's who is going to go in there alongside them. I personally think it is much better to have the Liberal Democrats around the cabinet table than Alex Salmond or Nigel Farage.'",

    "source": "A majority of the public does not want Camilla to become queen if Prince Charles succeeds to the throne, a poll for the Daily Mail reveals today. And the nation is completely split on whether Charles should become king at all. Only 43 per cent believe he should ascend to the throne compared with an almost identical number saying he should stand aside in favour of his elder son Prince William. William and Prince Harry are the most popular members of the Royal Family, closely followed by the Queen and the Duchess of Cambridge. Scroll down for video . A majority of the British public does not want to Camilla (left) to become Queen if the Prince of Wales (right) succeeds to the throne, a Daily Mail poll reveals . Four out of ten people think Prince Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William (pictured with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge) Prince Andrew languishes at the bottom of the\u00a0popularity table, with his brother Edward not far ahead. Camilla and Andrew are the only two royals who are more disliked than liked, according to the poll. Despite courtiers\u2019 efforts to have Camilla accepted into the nation\u2019s hearts, 55 per cent are against the Duchess of Cornwall becoming queen when her husband becomes king. This is down from 73 per cent opposition at the time of her wedding to Charles in April 2005, but shows she has yet to win over most of the country. However, she is no longer regarded as the main culprit for the break-up of Charles\u2019s marriage to Princess Diana. The prince himself is held most to blame by 39 per cent, followed by Diana on 13 per cent and Camilla on 12 per cent. There is still great affection for Diana, who died in a Paris car crash 18 years ago, with a substantial majority saying she would have made a better queen than Camilla. Intriguingly, the younger generation is most attached to her even though many of them were not old enough to remember her when she was alive. Among 18 to 24-year-olds, two out of three would have preferred Diana to be queen, while only 3 per cent backed Camilla. Charles\u2019s wedding to Camilla divided the country at the time, and ten years on people remain uncertain about its wider significance for the Royal Family. Fifteen per cent said the marriage had strengthened the monarchy but 24 per cent believed it had weakened it; just over half felt it had no impact. Camilla, 67, was once reviled as the woman whose love affair with Charles, 66, destroyed his relationship with Diana, who was 36 when she died in 1997. Prince William and his son George . Four out of ten people say Prince Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William. Britain is evenly split on the question of whether Charles should succeed to the throne when the Queen dies, the poll reveals. William has the female vote, with 43 per cent of women saying he should be the next monarch compared to 37 per cent of men. Young people are also much more likely to favour the Duke of Cambridge as king, with 53 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds urging his father to step aside. But 43 per cent of the public back Charles to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as Britain\u2019s next monarch. The findings suggest that support for the Prince of Wales to wear the crown may actually have dipped slightly in the past decade. In 2005 a survey found that 53 per cent of people thought he should be king despite his marriage to Camilla, and 43 per cent said he should not. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall outside St George's Chapel, Windsor after their civil wedding in 2004 . Senior officials at Clarence House have nurtured the duchess\u2019s image with carefully chosen public appearances. She has won widespread praise for her charity work, dedication to attending royal functions around the country and emergence as a style icon for older women. The Duchess of Cornwall is patron or president of 85 charities, and has undertaken nearly 1,700 royal engagements in Britain and more than 600 abroad since 2005. Yet the survey reveals how Camilla\u2019s past continues to affect how she is perceived. Just over a third said they had grown to like her more over the past decade, and nearly two-thirds thought Charles was happier with her than he ever was with Diana. Prince Andew languishes at the bottom of the popularity table . But only a quarter felt the Duchess of Cornwall had been a good influence on the Royal Family, and a similar proportion argued that her marriage to the prince had \u2018stained\u2019 the royals\u2019 reputation. Four in ten say Charles should give up his right to be king so the crown passes straight to William. Among those aged 18 to 24, that figure rises to 53 per cent. But overall 43 per cent of the public back Charles to take over from his mother, with a clear majority of over-55s wanting him as the next monarch. Support for the monarchy itself remains very high, with the 88-year-old Queen and the younger royals \u2013 William, Harry and Kate \u2013 hugely popular. By contrast, Prince Andrew was least popular, with only 30 per cent liking him. Charles, Prince Philip and Princess Anne were ranked in the middle. Only 19 per cent would back turning Britain into a republic, although the figure rises to 36 per cent in Scotland, perhaps a by-product of the SNP\u2019s unsuccessful independence campaign last year. Charles, who is said to favour a \u2018slimmed down\u2019 monarchy, will be buoyed by the finding that 56 per believe that the royals should be reduced to the Queen\u2019s immediate family only. By law Camilla will automatically become Queen Consort when Charles is king, but privately officials continue to debate whether she should use a lesser title to avoid controversy. The official position has been that she intends to be known as Princess Consort, but in recent years Camilla and Charles have dropped a number of hints that they would like her to be queen. Asked in 2010 whether his wife would take the title, Charles replied: \u2018We\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we? That could be.\u2019 The duchess herself says \u2018You never know\u2019 when she faces questions about whether she will become queen. Nearly two-thirds of people thought Charles was happier with Camilla than he ever was with Diana (pictured) Princes William and Harry are the most popular members of the royal family, the survey found. Nearly eight out of ten people said they \u2018liked\u2019 the princes, with the Duchess of Cambridge and the Queen receiving similarly high ratings. Women were significantly more likely to approve of the younger royals \u2013 84 per cent said they were fans of Prince Harry compared to 75 per cent of men. By contrast, Prince Andrew was the least popular of the royals, with only 30 per cent of respondents saying they liked him. Prince Charles, his father Prince Philip and his sister Princess Anne were ranked in the middle. Camilla divided opinions most sharply. Thirty-four per cent of people said they liked her, but 38 per cent disliked her. The survey did not ask people what they thought of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s son Prince George, who is now nearly two. Princes William and Harry are the most popular members of the royal family .",

    "source": "Young professional footballers can be an easy target with some of their behaviour but on Thursday afternoon it was refreshing to sit down and talk with Danny Welbeck. He struck me as a thoroughly decent young man who lives his life the right way. He is a credit to his family and his easy-going manner means he must a dream to work with. We discussed life at Arsenal, scoring against Manchester United and his FA Cup dreams. You can watch the full interview on Football Focus on BBC One today at 12.10pm and Reading\u2019s semi-final with Arsenal live on BBC One from 5.05pm. Danny Welbeck talks to Sportsmail's Martin Keown ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi-final against Reading . MARTIN KEOWN: You\u2019ve played at Wembley many times and you\u2019ve played in a semi-final as well but you\u2019re now one step away from an FA Cup final. Does that bring extra nerves? DANNY WELBECK:\u00a0Not really. I think we\u2019ve basically just got to play the game, not the occasion. The team was in this position last year and coming up against Wigan proved to be one of the toughest games of the season. Against Reading today is going to be another tough game. We\u2019ve just got to approach it the right way and we want to get through to the final. Welbeck expects a tough test as Arsenal face a Championship side at Wembley for the second year in a row . KEOWN: How are you settling in? You seem to have been here all your life almost and you\u2019ve only been here seven or eight months. WELBECK:\u00a0The staff at the club, at the training ground and everyone has been very welcoming. The fans have been brilliant. My team-mates are class and I\u2019m just really enjoying my time here. I\u2019ve settled in very well. It\u2019s a transitional year for me, getting to know new players, new team-mates, new systems and new ways of going about things at a different club. I think I\u2019ve put in a few good performances. I\u2019ve been unlucky on the club front with goals and that\u2019s something I know will come in abundance when I get to know everything spot on with the club and I\u2019m pretty sure that will happen. The Arsenal striker thinks he has been unlucky in front of goal, but wants to play in a more central role . KEOWN: You talk about goals, you\u2019re playing in a wide position. What\u2019s your favourite position? WELBECK: It\u2019s no secret I prefer to play down the middle. But the formation we play at Arsenal, you\u2019re playing on the left or the right. We\u2019re always interchanging, playing in a three-man attack. It\u2019s much easier doing that than playing left midfield or left wing in a four-man midfield. KEOWN: Wenger has worked with lots of strikers over the years and been able to develop them. What\u2019s the area that he\u2019s working on most with you most of all? WELBECK: We talk about the game, we analyse performances and on the training pitch we\u2019ve also got the other staff here so after training we do a bit of individual work so that happens every day. You are always looking at ways to improve as a player, to develop and I feel like I am developing well as a player. Welbeck, who says he has been made to feel very welcome at Arsenal, holds of Nacho Monreal in training . KEOWN: Is it your movement he works on? Is it holding up the ball? Finishing? Or is it a combination? WELBECK: It\u2019s a combination of everything. You don\u2019t just work on one thing. Every single day all the lads after training go out and do finishing. KEOWN: Does that become competitive? To see who can score the most goals? WELBECK: Yeah it does! It gets competitive but it\u2019s obviously all fun. But at the end of the day nobody wants to come last. We work on a lot of areas of our game. Like his team-mate Theo Walcott, Welbeck is often forced out wide, despite preferring being a central striker . KEOWN: In the last round you put out Manchester United. How did it feel to score at Old Trafford? WELBECK: It was a weird occasion for me going to back to Old Trafford on the away side. The weirdest thing was warming up on the other side of the pitch. It just felt a bit weird. But you have to treat it like it\u2019s any other game and play the game, not the occasion. Obviously I was going back to a club that brought me up and going back to the fans that supported me for years, playing against old team-mates, my old friends, it was a weird occasion. But I scored the goal, a big goal to get us through to the semi-final. So it was a spur of the moment to celebrate. The English international scored the winning goal on his return to Old Trafford in the quarter finals last month . KEOWN: Did it cross your mind not to celebrate? WELBECK:\u00a0Leading up to the game I had no plans whatsoever. I just wanted to play the game, get it over and done with and get through to Wembley and get to the semi-final. That\u2019s what happened. I scored the goal and whatever I did I would have been criticised \u2013 criticised if I celebrated or criticised if I didn\u2019t. It was just spur of the moment. KEOWN: Against Manchester United you seemed extra motivated. Was it anything to do with Louis Van Gaal\u2019s comments before the match? WELBECK:\u00a0I didn\u2019t see the comments. Going into every game I want to be motivated. Playing against Manchester United \u2013 I did it earlier in the season at the Emirates \u2013 and then it was a bit different this time going back to Old Trafford. There was motivation there but I\u2019m motivated in every game. I want to do well for my team, try and win the game and in that case get through to the semi-final. Listen, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, some you like, some you don\u2019t like but that\u2019s just football and it\u2019s life. You deal with it. Welbeck celebrates in front of his old fans, a decision he says was entirely spur of the moment . KEOWN: I think you showed a lot of mental strength going into that situation. It\u2019s always difficult going back. WELBECK:\u00a0You\u2019ve got to be strong mentally living the life and being a professional footballer. There\u2019s a lot of people out to get you and whatever you do, everyone\u2019s watching. You\u2019ve just got to be switched on 100 per cent of the time. That\u2019s just the way I\u2019ve been brought up. My parents are lovely, caring people and they look after me well, they brought me up well and it\u2019s the same with me and my brothers that\u2019s credit to them. The striker has quickly become a favourite at the Emirates, and he thanked the fans for their support . KEOWN: This weekend it\u2019s Reading. Have you looked much at their team? WELBECK:\u00a0You get to watch a few games throughout the season. I know they\u2019ve got players with Premier League experience. I\u2019ve seen them a couple of games this season being a bit direct. [Pavel] Pogrebnyak\u2019s a player they look for quite often from the back and the wingers will be coming inside to get the ball and flick-ons. Hal Robson-Kanu plays a bit more inside and [Gareth] McCleary is a bit more out and out on the right wing. Welbeck has been working hard in training to try and improve his finishing, along with his team-mates . KEOWN: Good knowledge\u2026 . WELBECK: Yeah I know quite a lot about football! KEOWN: As a centre forward or a winger, do you look for the weaknesses in the opposition? WELBECK: You\u2019ve got to analyse the positives and negatives in every single team. You look at that and obviously see where you can nullify their attack and see where their weaknesses are at the back. The Gunners forward picked out Pavel Pogrebnyak as one of Reading's most dangerous players . KEOWN: How much would it mean to you to get to the FA Cup final? WELBECK:\u00a0It would mean a lot. I\u2019ve been in this position before with Man United when we played Everton in the semi-finals a few years back and we lost on penalties. I remember the situation, I remember how I felt that day and that\u2019s something I don\u2019t want to feel again. I just want to get to the next stage, get to the final. This is a very important game so we\u2019re all looking forward to it, we\u2019re going to approach it like it\u2019s any other and play the game not the occasion.",

    "source": "Ed Miliband will do 'more damage to the country than he did to his brother', Boris Johnson said this morning as the pair clashed on live TV. The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match . No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience . The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it . Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP . Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument . Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there . Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: \u2018Are you for keeping non-dom status? You\u2019re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don\u2019t pay taxes here.\u2019 Mr Johnson responded: \u2018Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?\u2019 The Labour leader hit back, saying: \u2018Don\u2019t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: \u2018You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: \u2018He doesn\u2019t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.\u2019 But the London Mayor replied: \u2018I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back.\u00a0But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.\u2019",

    "source": "Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling is no stranger to the back pages, but he hit the headlines again for all the wrong reasons on Sunday after he was allegedly pictured smoking a shisha pipe. In a photograph revealed by the Sunday\u00a0Mirror, the 20-year-old is seen taking a drag from the large orange pipe \u2013 containing fruit-scented tobacco and smoked through hot coals via a tube \u2013 in a picture published in the Sunday Mirror. Sterling recently snubbed a new \u00a3100,000-a-week contract at Anfield amid fears he could leave the club this summer. Liverpool midfielder Raheem Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . The 20-year-old (second right) recently snubbed a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer from the Merseyside club . The England international (right) played in the Red's FA Cup quarter final win over Blackburn on Wednesday . Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was snapped on a social media site with the picture captioned \u20181 down 3 to go\u2019, suggesting there was more puffing in store for the youngster that night. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes. Having already irked certain Reds fans for refusing to dedicate his immediate future to Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team after being offered the improved contract offer, he could again cut an unpopular figure for putting his health at risk during the Merseysiders\u2019 run in to fight for a top four place in the Premier League. Sterling (second right) attended the launch of the 2015-16 Liverpool kit at Anfield on Friday afternoon . There was a large turnout for the launch of the new kit,\u00a0which will be worn throughout the 2015-16 season . On the The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: \u2018Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' However Sterling is not the first England international to be caught indulging himself in the increasingly popular fad. Jack Wilshere became embroiled in his third smoking controversy in 15 months after a picture emerged of the Arsenal midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub in February. The 23-year-old was recovering from ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during a defeat by Manchester United in November last year. Choosing to keep his disciplinary plans private at the time of Wilshere's misdemeanour, Gunners boss Arsene Wenger was clear about his views on players that choose inhale potentially harmful substances. England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) was involved in a smoking controversy back in February . 'I disagree completely with that behaviour,' the Frenchman said. 'When you're a football player you are an example and as well you don't do what damages your health. 'When you go out socially [and smoke] you as well damage your reputation as an example.' Depending on the result in the Manchester derby on Sunday afternoon, Sterling and his Liverpool team-mates could close the gap between themselves and fourth placed Manchester City to four points if the Blues fall to their local rivals and if they defeat Newcastle on Monday.",

    "source": "A mother whose baby nearly died after he was born severely premature has urged other women to be aware of the infection that triggered her early labour. Amanda Butler, 42, had enjoyed a totally normal pregnancy until her waters broke at 25 weeks. Her son Callum was born weighing just 1lb 9oz and with translucent skin - and both she and doctors feared he would not survive. In the weeks and months that followed, he underwent heart surgery, a lumbar puncture, laser eye surgery and 10 blood transfusions. Mrs Butler, a marketing consultant from Milton Keynes, later discovered her premature labour had been triggered by a common infection called bacterial vaginosis (BV). Scroll down for video . Callum Butler was born at just 25 weeks into his mother's pregnancy. His mother Amanda was later told an infection she had, called bacterial vaginosis, was to blame. The condition can also cause miscarriage . BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Many other women, such as Mrs Butler, have simply never heard of the condition. She said: 'I was angry when I found out that BV had caused Callum\u2019s premature birth because it was the first I had heard of it. 'No-one ever told me the condition could lead to complications like this. 'It wasn't in any of the pregnancy books and was certainly never mentioned by midwives or doctors prior to it happening.' She said she noticed a discharge at around 24 weeks - but didn\u2019t pay it any attention. 'Pregnancy itself can cause that to happen, and it certainly didn\u2019t concern my midwife,' she recalled. 'The discharge didn\u2019t have the characteristic odour that is associated with BV.' After the trauma of the premature labour and birth, Mrs Butler was initially told it had occurred because she had an 'incompetent cervix'. This is a condition that occurs when weak cervical tissue causes the cervix to open too soon - causing premature birth or the loss of an otherwise healthy pregnancy. It was only during a consultation with a specialist two years later that she was horrified to be told an infection must have caused Callum's early arrival. 'I feel like it could have been totally avoided had I been given the right information,' she said. Like many women, Mrs Butler had never heard of the condition. Callum's frail state when he was born meant doctors feared he may not live.\u00a0'I feel like it could have been totally avoided had I been given the right information,' his mother said . 'Callum\u2019s experience was awful, and it was incredibly difficult for my husband and I to have to watch him suffer. 'As a new mum, it was heartbreaking not to be able to cuddle my son for weeks after he was born.' She added: 'Today, Callum is a happy, healthy little boy, but I am definitely one of the lucky ones.' She has decided to share her story to raise awareness and prevent other mothers going through the same terrible ordeal. 'I don\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through what Callum endured,' she said. 'I would urge anyone in the early stages of pregnancy who thinks they may have the symptoms of BV to speak to their midwives as soon as possible to ensure this terrible experience doesn\u2019t happen to them.' Around 54,000 babies are born prematurely in UK every year, one of the highest rates in Europe. BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush. It occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. If untreated, it can lead to fertility problems and increased risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. One of the biggest problems is that BV often goes undiagnosed - or women wrongly assume they are suffering from another similar ailment, such as thrush. Misdiagnosis often occurs as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums because while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP, research has shown. Symptoms include: . * a strong smell, particularly after sexual intercourse . * discharge that becomes a white or grey colour, or\u00a0becomes thin and watery . Babies born before 37 weeks are classed as premature and as many of their vital organs will not have had a chance to fully develop causing both short terms problems, such as breathing and digestive difficulties, and potential longer term health implications, such as severe disabilities or cerebral palsy. Her story follows research at the University of California, Los Angeles, which found women who use shower gels and soaps in intimate areas are putting themselves at higher risk of developing BV. Study leader Joelle Brown said there is \u2018mounting evidence\u2019 that using these products internally can also increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis. Dr Brown's team recruited 141 women in Los Angeles who agreed to answer questionnaires about their product use and undergo lab tests for vaginal infections. The researchers found that 66 per cent of the women reported using lubricants and cleansers internally. The most commonly used products were sexual lubricants - 70 per cent of the product-using group used commercial lubricants, while 17 per cent reported using petroleum jelly and 13 per cent used oils. Test results showed that the women who used products not intended for internal use, such as oils and Vaseline, were more likely to have yeast and bacterial infections. For instance, 40 per cent of the women who used petroleum jelly as a lubricant had bacterial vaginosis - an infection that can be caused by a number of common bacterial species - compared to 18 per cent of women who did not insert petroleum jelly. Mrs Butler was speaking out for National BV Day, held in association with Balance Activ. For more information on the condition, visit www.bvexplained.co.uk .",

The Transport Workers' Union's National Secretary Tony Sheldon condemned the requested change to the Fair Work Act and accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. 'Major retailers like Aldi are trying to turn the clocks back on our modern society to reintroduce serfdom,' Mr Sheldon in a statement. Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to Workplace Relations Productivity Commission . 'Their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part-time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Tony Sheldon, \u00a0accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom . His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the Workplace Relations Productivity Commission, in which it recommended that the National Employment Standards be amended to 'enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees 'overwhelmingly supported' and 'preferred' the proposals. 'ALDI's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' David Zalunardo, Aldi's managing director, wrote. However Mr Sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to 'strip workers of their rights'. 'The Transport Workers' Union and its members acted against this billion-dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is \"not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy\"' 'Aldi then failed the legal and fairness test, but now in a submission to the Productivity Commission it is seeking again to scrap the same safeguards. 'We can only hope that Aldi's dream for the Australian economy never comes true.' The grocery store also protested union's power to interfere in enterprise agreements, arguing that a recent incident, in which a union representing only 'a very small number of employees' delayed an agreement, caused 'negative consequences\u2026in terms of uncertainty, financial costs and distraction from managing the business'. 'Based on our experience, the length of time taken for FWC consideration of enterprise agreements can be unduly prolonged, costly and disruptive to continuing business operations, which is disadvantageous to all stakeholders. This is not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy,' Mr\u00a0Zalunardo wrote. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is \"not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy\".'",

The cost of divorce can wreck retirement many years after the break-up of a marriage, according to research. People who have never been divorced can expect a retirement income 13 per cent higher than a colleague who has been through a divorce. It means an extra \u00a32,100 a year \u2013 \u00a317,800 rather than \u00a315,700 \u2013 to anyone who has kept their marriage intact, or who has never married, according to the survey for the Prudential. It also found that one in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles. The debt of a divorced retiree averages \u00a322,100, Prudential\u2019s report said, while many divorced people will have to get by on low incomes after ending their careers. Researchers said that nearly one in five divorced people will retire on incomes of less that \u00a39,500 \u2013 the level identified by poverty analysts at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank as the minimum income for a single pensioner to enjoy a decent life. By comparison, only 13 per cent of people who are not divorced will be below the line, yesterday\u2019s report said. The impact of divorce on a former spouse\u2019s wealth is such that divorcees coming up to retirement age are 13 per cent more likely to delay retirement and continue working. The study adds to evidence that neither the emotional nor the financial effects of divorce are quickly overcome by families that break up. Years of research have established that the children of divorced parents are likely to do worse at school, worse in their careers after they leave school, to be more at risk of taking drugs or falling into crime, and to suffer worse health. The impact of divorcing parents lasts long after a child has grown up and become an independent adult, studies suggests . The latest survey provides new evidence that the financial crash that husbands, wives and children suffer during a divorce \u2013 usually including loss of income, the price of running two homes instead of one, legal costs, and the long-term burden of maintenance payments for one spouse \u2013 does not fade away even as old age approaches. Apart from the costs of supporting a former partner who is bringing up their children, a divorced man or woman faces giving up a share of their pension when they retire through \u2018pension-splitting\u2019 arrangements. One in five divorcees who stop work this year will retire with debts to drag down their disposable income and their lifestyles, according to research . Prudential pensions specialist Clare Moffat said: \u2018Although the emotional impact of divorce may have long passed, it could come as a shock for people to find that it continues to impact them financially into their retirement. \u2018A pension fund is likely to be one of the largest and most complicated assets a couple will have to split in the event of a divorce. Professional advice is particularly important in the face of the recent changes to pensions legislation and divorced retirees acting on advice received under the previous rules may want to consider seeking updated advice on any post-retirement plans they have made. \u2018During a divorce the costs can quickly mount up, with legal fees, the cost of setting up a new home and the effect of splitting any existing retirement savings all potentially impacting the ability of those involved to continue saving into a pension. Unfortunately divorce is most likely among those aged 40 to 44, the period in many people\u2019s lives when earning potential peaks and the most valuable pension contributions can be made.\u2019 The findings were based on a survey carried out by Research Pluse among 7,687 people aged over 45, who included 1,012 people intending to retire this year.",

A Chinese team took a kite measuring an astonishing 6,000 metres (3.7 miles) to a kite flying festival - aiming to break the world record by a massive 1,000 metres. But they had overlooked the fact that their kite was so big, it posed a danger to passing aircraft. The kite, dubbed 'centipede with a dragon's head', was set to fly at the Wulong International Kite Festival last Saturday in Chongqing in south-western China, according to\u00a0People's Daily Online. Scroll down for video . Flying high: Half of the 6,000-metre-long dragon-themed kite took to the sky in Chongqing last Saturday . Skilful: The kite weighs 200 kilograms and requires three experienced kite flyers to\u00a0manoeuvre . However, Chinese aviation authorities ruled that the dragon-themed kite - which is made from 2,000 separate pieces and weighs a whopping 200 kilograms - could not be flown, and the team were forced to fly only half of it. The weather at the kite flying festival in Chongqing undoubtedly played a part, with a heavy mist reducing visibility not only for pilots but for spectators who had turned up to witness the annual event. Each of the 2,000 pieces bears the Chinese characters 'China Dream' and it takes eight hours to get the full-length kite airborne. Wang Dongming, one of the three kite flyers, said special sturdier rope made from kevlar - which is also used to make bulletproof vests - had to be used to thread the  kite. Mr Wang said: 'Big kites and kites that are used for trick flying are usually built from this kevlar rope to prevent the line from snapping in the wind.' In order to secure the pieces on the kite, craftsmen only used bamboo that was more than three years old which can resist severe wind. Colourful: Kites of all shapes and shades take to the sky in Chongqing during the four-day-long festival . Although the kite did not fly full-length, organisers of the festival still claimed that they had broken the Guinness World Record for the longest kite in the world. The previous record is reported to set by a 5,000m-long kite made by craftsmen in Weifang in eastern China last spring. Professional kite flying teams from over 13 countries participated in the four-day-long Wulong International Kite Festival, including representatives from China, New Zealand, the UK and Italy.

Officer Michael Rapiejko ran his car into Mario Valencia in February as the suspect carried a rifle he had just fired in the air. Rapiejko sped around another officer as Valencia walked through a business park, hit the man from behind with the left side of his front bumper. Valencia, who flew through this air, survived and faces more than a dozen charges for an alleged crime spree that day. His lawyer has said police used excessive force and could have killed a man who was obviously unstable. The Marana Police Department has defended Rapiejko, saying deadly force was warranted because the suspect had a rifle, ammunition and was walking toward offices where hundreds of people work. Marana is just northwest of Tucson. Officer who drove into suspect justified, chief says . KVOA obtained police inquiry tapes on which Rapiejko tells investigators why he chose his car as a weapon. The officer, who has been a cop for more than a decade but joined the Marana Police Department in 2014, said he was 50 yards away from the suspect and worried a missed shot might hit another officer or bystanders. \"There were occupied businesses, and there were two officers at the other side of the street,\" he says on the recording. \"This is what I deem as a lethal force encounter. I have two thoughts that go in my mind: I need to shoot him to stop the threat, or I need to run him over to stop the threat.\" Another officer, who was slowing trailing Valencia and ahead of Rapiejko, says on another recording that if a civilian had stumbled upon Valencia, the suspect might have taken a hostage or killed the person.

    "source": "An Israeli geologist claims he has \u2018confirmed\u2019 the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary \u2013 a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother \u2013 to the long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) \u2013 a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead \u2013 to the long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019 and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron\u2019s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, \u2018Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron\u2019s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 in the city\u2019s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, \u2018James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus\u2019. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the \u2018crust\u2019 of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the \u2018Jesus Family tomb\u2019 where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries \u2013 15 of which were from unrelated tombs \u2013 and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of \u2018Rendzina\u2019 soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the \u2018holy\u2019 location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, \u2018Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, \u2018Judah, son of Jesus\u2019. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: \u2018This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.\u2019 Dr Shumron told The New York Times: \u2018I think I\u2019ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.\u2019 The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: \u2018 The evidence is beyond what I expected.\u2019 The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv.",

    "source": "The Health Secretary promised a crackdown if the Conservatives are re-elected . Ending the \u2018abuse\u2019 of NHS money exposed by the Mail will be a priority if the Conservatives are re-elected, the Health Secretary said last night. Speaking as the Mail revealed how NHS managers were potentially dodging income tax by channelling huge salaries through personal companies, Jeremy Hunt promised an immediate crackdown if his party is in power after the election. He said: \u2018The Mail\u2019s campaign has exposed that off-payroll contracts are clearly being abused both at a management level and in the hiring of agency staff. So we will stop the abuse as a priority if we form the next government.\u2019 His comments led a storm of reaction from all political parties, as well as health experts and medical professionals. The Mail yesterday revealed how hospital bosses had taken \u00a335million in pay rises during the worst funding crisis in a generation. And today it can be revealed that some could dodge tax by channelling salaries through personal companies. The practice is being used by temporary executives \u2013 some of whom earn more than \u00a32,000 a day \u2013 and allows them to avoid paying income tax and national insurance in the normal way. Dr Sarah Wollaston, former Tory chairman of the health select committee, said: \u2018I was asked about the Mail\u2019s investigation today at an open public meeting. People are right to be concerned about the best use of public money.\u2019 Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham has also vowed that a Labour government would investigate the Mail\u2019s evidence. And he said the astonishing pay rises should be \u2018clawed back\u2019, adding: \u2018It cannot be right at a time when NHS staff have been asked to accept years of [pay] freezes to see this level of excess at the top.\u2019 The extraordinary pay deals have also been condemned by the Royal College of Nursing, which branded them \u2018shocking\u2019, while health experts including the Royal College of Physicians and government health adviser Sir Brian Jarman demanded a review. Former Commons public accounts committee chairman Margaret Hodge, who investigated tax avoidance by public officials three years ago, said NHS trusts should be \u2018hauled\u2019 before MPs to be held to account. \u2018This is a way of avoiding tax,\u2019 the Labour MP said. \u2018The reason the Treasury took action to stop public officials being paid through personal service companies was because my committee uncovered this was going on. \u2018I\u2019m cross the Government has not stopped this and a future government has got to sort it out. \u2018They should make it a condition that if you are being paid with taxpayer money you have to be properly on the books.\u2019 Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said the situation was \u2018ludicrous\u2019, adding: \u2018There is no way of justifying it.\u2019 Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said: \u2018It\u2019s sickening to see top NHS bosses using the tax rules for personal gain.\u2019 Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham said his party would investigate the Mail's findings if elected .",

    "source": "Charlie Chaplin's divorce papers lay bare the film star's 'cruel and inhumane' treatment of his teenage bride during their short-lived marriage. Chaplin's union to Lita Grey, who was nearly 20 years his junior, lasted just three years. The iconic film star was said have bedded the impressionable 16-year-old after promising her marriage and then tried to convince her to have an abortion when she fell pregnant. On the pairs wedding night Chaplin was also said to have confided in friends that the union was a better prospect than prison. An original copy of the couples 50-page divorce papers was set to fetch an estimated \u00a315,000 when it goes under the hammer, after being found in America. The 50-page divorce papers of Charlie Chaplin and his second wife Lita Grey were found in a bank in America . Charlie Chaplin, left, married second wife Lita Grey, right, who was nearly 20 years his jounior, in 1924 and the union lasted for just three years . The divorce papers are set to fetch an estimated \u00a315,000 when they go under the hammer in Plymouth . Chaplin, then 35, married his second wife Lita, 16, in 1924. They divorced just three years later with the teenager lifting the lid on their marriage. In the papers it was alleged that Chaplin slept with the 'virtuous and inexperienced' Lita when she was barely 16 after promising to marry her. On their wedding night Chaplin was said to have told friends that the marriage was a better option than prison. He said to Lita: 'This marriage won't last long, I will make you so damn sick of me that you won't want to live with me.' Another part claims Chaplin delayed marrying Lita after she fell pregnant in an attempt to get her to have an abortion or 'criminal operation'. And the silent movie star was accused of calling his young bride a 'gold digger' who tried to ruin his career and stood in the way if his professional success. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings. Only around 16 copies of the divorce proceedings were believed to have been made, one sent to Chaplin himself and the others sent to various film companies and banks, involved in the proceedings. The papers for sale in Devon, were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927. Almost a century later they are being sold by Parade Antiques on Plymouth for \u00a315,000. The papers for sale were sent to the 1st National Bank of Los Angeles on the 11th Jan 1927 . Lita claimed that she endured 'cruel and inhumane' treatment by Chaplin in the legal papers . John Cabello, who owns the antiques shop, said: 'We got it from a person in America - he was told to clear out some supplies and old documents at the bank and he found them. 'He was told they would be thrown away and he kept them instead. 'When the papers were published, Chaplin was ostracised for a while. People in the know thought he was quite a nasty piece of work. 'All this comes out and makes for quite hard reading, even by today's standards.' Rob Morrish, 27, who runs the shop's website, poured over the historic legal documents. The 27-year-old said: 'About a week's worth of work went into researching the document, reading through it took some time. 'It's all hand signed and very old and fragile. It was folded for a long time and required a lot of very careful handling.' The papers reveal intimate details of the couples unstable relationship, believed to be an attempt by Lita's lawyers to tarnish Chaplin's reputation and gain a bigger settlement. Mr Morrish said: 'They met on set of one of his films and he seduced her as a young woman. It was frowned upon but he tried to make the most of the situation. 'When she became pregnant he wasn't particularly pleased to be trapped in a marriage. 'He squirrelled her away and did not report the birth until months later to make it look like the child was conceived after they wedded. The papers also contain an order stopping Chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings . Lita was granted a $800,000 settlement when the couple eventually divorced in 1927 . 'She was quite a young woman when they divorced and she was being sent by her lawyers to get as much as they could. She has said she regretted it in later life. 'It was way above and beyond what is standard for divorce proceedings, even for now.' Eventually in 1927, Lita and Chaplin divorced and she was granted a settlement of $800,000, the largest at the time. Mr Morrish said: 'She achieved what her lawyers wanted. In the end she got what she wanted but he still had a fantastic career after that.'",

    "source": "Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorist group, according to an Iraqi source. The source said that he was wounded by an attack from the US-led coalition while travelling in a three-car convoy in March in Nineveh, Iraq. At first his chances of survival were deemed by his lieutenants to be low, but he pulled through. Scroll down for video . Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) has been seriously injured in an air strike and is no longer in control of the terrorists, according to an Iraqi source . However, he was left so weakened that his inner circle reportedly mooted the idea of naming a new leader. He is slowly recovering but does not have the reins of the organisation, according to The Guardian. Two officials confirmed to the paper that the strike on the convoy did indeed take place, on March 18 in the al-Baaj district of Nineveh, not far from the Syrian border. One, a Western diplomat, told the paper that Coalition generals weren\u2019t sure whether al-Baghdadi was in the convoy. News of the attack follows contradictory accounts of al-Baghdadi being killed in air strikes in November and December . Another, an Iraqi expert on Isis used by the government in Baghdad in an advisory capacity, revealed that he had in fact been wounded. He said: \u2018Yes, he was wounded in al-Baaj near the village of Umm al-Rous on 18 March with a group that was with him.\u2019 This area is known to be largely lawless and a hotbed of jihadi activity, with very little Coalition air presence. Raffaello Pantucci, Director of International Security Studies for defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told MailOnline that it\u2019s entirely plausible that the infamous leader had been hit, but warned that it might not have a long-term impact on the group if he didn't survive. He said: \u2018We\u2019ve heard these stories before. It's possible, as they would be going after him and they would be trying to drone him, but it\u2019s right to be suspicious. 'If he was killed it would have a big effect on the group as a lot of the group is wrapped up in his identity. The whole of Islamic State is built on success and if the leader is bumped off it\u2019s harder to say you\u2019re winning. \u2018But it\u2019s quite a resilient group. They would do a PR piece on it and say he\u2019s gone to a better place \u2013 but coherence often comes from leadership. \u2018However, it would not mean the end of the group by any stretch.\u2019 Last year there were two reports that Baghdadi had been wounded, but they turned out to be inaccurate. He escaped death in December when US jets attacked a two-car convoy on the outskirts of Mosul. His close aide Auf Abdul Rahman al-Efery was killed when a rocket fired from a war plane hit one of the cars. Baghdadi was believed to be in the second car, which was not hit. Figures from February showed allied airstrikes, including those carried out by British warplanes, had killed more than 6,000 fighters since September. The figure included more than half of the militants on the IS ruling council. Among the dead jihadists was also Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi\u2019s number two and the most senior IS militant in Iraq. His death and that of as many as nine others on the 18-man leadership council forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists became increasingly small. Baghdadi, 43, was the head of al-Qaeda in Iraq before founding the Islamic State in Iraq in 2010, while he was declared head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in 2013. In June last year, the Islamic State declared itself a caliphate, with al-Baghdadi declared as its \u2018Caliph\u2019 or ruler.",

A scammer who was the ringleader of a fraud gang has been ordered to repay nearly \u00a31million which he stole from the life savings of an innocent victim. Rilwan Oshodi bought Karen Budow's bank account details for just \u00a33,200 and spent her savings on cheeseburgers, bottles of champagne and top-of-the-range computers. He now claims he is so broke he can't even pay his lawyers - but a judge told him today that if he does not return his ill-gotten gains he will have to spend four more years in prison. Nigerian Oshodi, 31, bought Ms Budow's Santander details from an Egyptian hacker Tamer Abdulhamid, who had persuaded her to hand them over as part of a fishing scam. His girlfriend Annette Jabeth then posed as the victim and withdrew her \u00a31million life savings, which the gang spent in a three-day shopping splurge in the New Year sales in January 2012. Detectives said that their purchases had ranged from cheeseburgers to high-end computers and gold', while Oshodi spent \u00a31,134 on taxis and bought expensive gadgets including a MacBook and an iPhone. One picture of him even appears to show him holding a 'money sandwich', with Nigerian banknotes stashed between two slices of bread. He was jailed for eight years in 2013 after being convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court for a confiscation hearing today, Oshodi insisted he had not profited from the scam, and denied hiding money in overseas bank accounts. Money sandwich: This image appears to show Oshodi with Nigerian banknotes in between slices of bread . Champagne: But the scammer insists he does not have enough money to pay what he has been ordered to . He said: 'If I have hidden the goods, if I have got money how come I can't pay my solicitor, how come I can't rent a house, how come I was still broke, how come I am still broke, how come I am still poor? 'Wouldn't I get myself a new car, would I not buy myself some new clothes, Louis Vuitton or something?' But judge Stephen Robbins said: 'I reject what he said today... he was the main mover and architect of this fraud and he has hidden assets most likely outside this jurisdiction. 'He said he got nothing from it at all, no benefit directly.' Determining Oshodi to have made \u00a3940,820.34 in profit from the fraud, the judge ordered that he repay the total sum within six months or face a further four years in jail. Girlfriend: Annette Jabeth was also jailed in 2013 for her part in Oshodi's fraud . Abdulhamid was jailed for six years after admitting three counts of conspiracy to defraud, but this year he was ordered to repay just \u00a3686 out of the \u00a374,000 profit he made from the scam. During a raid of Oshodi's home, detectives discovered computers with details of more than 11,000 credit cards, including those of almost 8,500 UK customers. In a victim impact statement, Ms Budow said she was 'physically shaking' when she was informed by the bank, adding: 'Since the theft I have been reimbursed the full amount by Santander.

Luke Stanwick, 30, is fighting for his life in a medically-induced coma and may never walk again after the 'horrendous' accident in Portugal. The police officer from Hailsham, East Sussex, was on holiday with his wife Jenny and their two-year-old son, Nathan, when he broke his neck. Mrs Stanwick said: 'He is my rock, my hero and most of all the man I adore without question. PC Luke Stanwick, 30,\u00a0has been left paralysed from the waist down after breaking his neck while on holiday with his family, pictured with his two-year-old son Nathan . 'Luke is outgoing and fun to be around and makes me smile every day, even now in our darkest moment together. 'He will fight to the ends of the earth to recover as much as he physically can for both me and our son, as well as the rest of his family.' He remains in hospital in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, where he was put into a\u00a0coma for extensive surgery. His father, Michael Stanwick, 62, said it was too early to know whether Luke's injuries will leave him permanently disabled. He said: 'Luke's still in hospital, he's suffered a broken neck. He's undergone extensive surgery and he is now in the recovery ward. 'He's undergoing physiotherapy treatment and he is on extensive pain relief. He's able to move his arms now, but it's early doors.

We're trying to get him to the appropriate facilities in this country but we don't know what the damage to the nerve is. 'There is a significant language barrier so it's quite an isolating experience but Luke is very fit, he's a very fit young man and he and I go to the gym together. 'Hearing the news was the most devastating news, we are slowly coming to terms with it. 'It's sad that these shocking things can happen right out of the blue. It brings too much pain to talk about.'

'It is too early to say how this will affect him in the long run and we still live in hope that he make a full recovery. 'In the meantime, it is heart-warming to see the efforts which are already underway to raise funds to support Luke and his family.'

    "source": "Alan Greaves, pictured, claimed 'the Illuminati framed him by downloading child abuse images on his computer . A father-of-eight caught with almost 20,000 images of child abuse on his computer and mobile claimed he was framed by the Illuminati. Police raided Alan Greaves's home in Colne, Lancashire in September 2013 where they found the disturbing images on a digital storage device. Forensic examination of the abuse images found almost 700 were of the most serious category, with a further 872 at the next level. Burnley Crown Court heard there were also 17,821 other indecent images with 106 movies. Laura Barbour, defending, said she had been instructed the reason Greaves had the images on his computer was because he was conducting an investigation on the 'Illuminati'. He believed the group 'disseminates' such material and that is how images ended up on his computer, the court heard. She added: 'He told police he has no interest in children sexually in any way.' The court was told the defendant, who has children aged around 30 to two-years-old, was also a full-time carer for his disabled sister. Jailing him for 21 months, Judge Simon Newell said there appeared to be sexually-explicit images of females aged just 10, or younger, which had assembled over a three-year period. 'If it was not for people viewing these images, there would be a chance these children would not be harmed,' he said. Greaves, who pleaded guilty to two offences of making indecent images, was also given a sexual harm prevention order and told to sign the sex offenders' register for the next 10 years. He is also barred from working with children. Burnley Crown Court, pictured, heard that almost 700 of the images were in the most serious category . The Illuminati featured in the movie Angels & Demons based on the best-selling novel by Dan Brown . Some conspiracy theorists claim the pyramid and eye on a US $1 note is evidence of the Illuminati . The Illuminati are a secret society who was founded in the late 1700s in Munich, Bavaria, named after the Latin word for 'Enlightenment'. The secret society has been blamed for a range of events by crazed conspiracy theorists. Some theorists have linked the organisation with the Battle of Waterloo; the French Revolution; the assassination of Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy. Others believe that the Illuminati control Hollywood and have a membership which includes senior political leaders. According to one conspiracy theory site, there are only 6,000 members worldwide with a ruling council consisting of five Americans, five western Europeans, one Russian and one Indian. The Illuminati claim they want to overthrow current governments and introduce their own New World Order. The organisation have been accused of being devil worshipers and conspiracy theorists claim that the Illuminati manifest their power by showing their symbols such as triangles, pyramids and the number 666. Conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati want to rule the world with a single government which they control and introduce a single currency. The more far-fetched theorists claim the Illuminati control groups such as the Bildeberg group as well as the United Nations. They are also accused of having control of the Free Masons and other secret organisations.",

    "source": "A family of four are lucky to be alive after a bedroom ceiling collapsed in their home. The damage was just part of the destruction caused by cowboy builders who had been called in to fix a leak in the Beckle-Raymond's three bedroom property in North London. Instead, they left Phillip, his wife Gaby and their two young children, Orion and Aurielle, in an unsafe building with no roof while they ran off with \u00a317,000 of their money. Scroll down for video . Phillip and Gaby outside their London home which was left a wreck thanks to cowboy builders . 'When the builders walked out, we only had tarpaulin protecting the house throughout winter,' Gaby explains on Channel 5 show Britain's Horror Homes. 'When it rained, water started coming in, it was raining inside our house. The box room caved in, the bathroom became bowed, the ceiling will fall in the children's room. 'The most terrifying experience was the ceiling falling in the bedroom where we used to sleep. It collapsed where our bed used to be. We weren't in room at time thankfully.' For six months, the family were forced to live in one room of the house as they couldn't afford to get the problems fixed straight away, having already shelled out to the cowboy builders who left them in the lurch. Phillip, a civil servant, said: 'The house was crumbling around us, we had to turn off the lights as water was getting into electricity, it was that time of year when it was getting dark at 4pm, it was miserable. I hated leaving Gaby and the children like that when I had to go to work.' Phillip and Gaby had used all their savings to buy the property five years before for \u00a3325,000. The builders left the family with no roof and just\u00a0tarpaulin protecting the house from the winter elements. As a result, rain got into the property causing ceilings to collapse . The parents say they are devastated at being 'taken for a ride'. It will cost \u00a335,000 to repair their home . As they started a family, they worked hard to turn the house into a happy and comfortable place to raise their children. When they sprung a small leak in part of the roof, they called in a builder who recommended they re-tile the roof at a cost of about \u00a33,000. But after removing all the tiles, he then told them that the roof structure was unsound so he wouldn't be able to re-tile. He suggested they use the opportunity to expand their home and add value to the property by adding a loft conversion. The couple thought it was great idea and decided to use a sub contractor their builder recommended and pay a \u00a37,000 deposit for the work. Gaby said: 'The first builder appeared to be trustyworthy and was very professional, very likable. 'We didn't have time to check out the sub contractor he recommended as we were without a roof which we needed to be fixed.' A back view of the property shows how the garden was left looking like a rubbish tip while the house had no roof. The family had to live in one room for six months as they couldn't afford the repairs . So far the couple had paid the first builder \u00a310,000 in total - and had a home with no roof to show for it. After the sub contractor began to work on their home, the first builder then disappeared. Phillip said: 'We heard from sub contractor that the builder's uncle was sick in Ireland so he was going there - we never hard from him again.' Meanwhile, the sub contractor began work on their loft conversion after asking for \u00a37,000 for materials and labour. But as the sub contractor got to work, the couple became suspicious about his competency. Gaby said: 'He was trying to build a loft conversion without steel supports - which we had paid for. 'That's when we realised he was trying to take us for a ride like the first guy.' Phillip added: 'When we told him it wasn't acceptable, he walked off the job. We were left with a roof no longer salvageable.' Shocking: The collapse of the roof left their home filled with rubble . Daylight: With the tiles gone, the family were left with bare rafters and no protection from the elements . The couple were unable to contact the first builder and have reported the sub contractor to Trading Standards. They have been left devastated by the state of their home - as well as \u00a317,000 out of pocket. 'We have lost the home we have been building over the last few years, our whole house has been destroyed, it's been a living nightmare. We wish they have never knocked on our door,' Gabby wept. 'I just want it fixed. I still can't believe someone would leave me my husband and our two children in so much danger. They didn't need to leave us in such an unsafe way.' But the family's trust in humanity has been partly restored thanks to the friends, family and strangers who rallied round to help them. A friend set up a fundraising page so people can donate money to help the couple reach the \u00a335,000 they will need to repair their home. Unsafe: The family are devastated that they have been left to live in an unsafe home . Damage: A local builder Darren Louis has been helping the family to clear up the mess left behind . A local builder, Darren Louis, has been working on the property at weekends - so far without payment - so the family have a roof over their heads again. He said: I wanted to help as this is my trade and they are a lovely family. They didn't need to do the work in the first place, they were scaremongered into it and then left with a house that's unsafe.' Gaby said: 'I feel terrible he's coming here and we haven't paid him. He's coming in trust that we will come through with money in the end.' Phillip said it's thanks to their friends, family and neighbours they have got through their ordeal. He said: 'We were left thinking \"can we trust anyone anymore?\" and now we know we can.'",

The Centurions twice came from behind in thrilling fashion to beat the Red Devils 22-18 in front of a 6,358 crowd at Leigh Sports Village and stretch their winning run to 21 matches. The build-up to the fifth-round tie was dominated by the selection by Leigh of former England forward Gareth Hock despite an agreement not to play against his old club, but he played little part in their downfall. Unbeaten Championship leaders Leigh delivered a stunning knockout blow as Super League club Salford crashed out of the Ladbrokes Challenge Cup . Hock, one of five ex-Salford players in the home line-up, spent just 25 minutes on the field in two spells and looked well short of match fitness. Instead it was left to former Wigan hooker Bob Beswick to orchestrate a magnificent display by Paul Rowley's men, who trailed 6-0 and 18-12 to their Super League visitors, who were badly hit by injuries and indebted to a superb performance from French half-back Theo Fages for keeping them in contention right to the end. The match was played amid a wonderful atmosphere and the ferocity was in evidence inside the first minute when Salford forward Cory Paterson was placed on report for a high and late tackle on Leigh full-back Gregg McNally. Fages opened the scoring after seven minutes when he dummied his way over for the first try and his half-back partner Michael Dobson kicked the conversion before hurting his knee in a collision four minutes later. Dobson attempted to play on but eventually succumbed to his injury and the Red Devils also lost centre Junior Sa'u with a wrist injury before half-time. With Paterson also limping, the visitors were rocked by the flair and determination of their Championship opponents, who scored two tries in four minutes to go 12-6 ahead. Beswick was the provider each time, a short pass getting veteran forward Tommy Goulden over from close range while McNally finished off his break from halfway, and Martyn Ridyard kicked both conversions. That was the signal for Hock to enter the fray but Salford turned the tables with two tries either side of the break from Niall Evalds to retake the lead. They drew level on 34 minutes when Fages broke clear to get the full-back over for his first try and got his over again three minutes into the second half courtesy of a neat reverse pass. Paterson kicked both goals to make it 18-12 and Leigh missed a glorious chance to level matters when centre Tom Armstrong got winger Liam Kay haring for the corner only for him to lose the ball in Fages' last-ditch tackle. Just when Salford seemed to be in control, the game took a new twist as Leigh stormed back in front. They were thrown a lifeline on 63 minutes when Salford winger Ben Jones-Bishop's careless pass was snapped up by Leigh half-back Ryan Brierley for a gift of a try. Ridyard's third goal tied the scores and the Centurions regained the lead three minutes later McNally fashioned a try for winger Johnathan Pownall. There was no shortage of action right to the end but Leigh, who pushed Leeds all the way in last year's quarter-final, hung on and just about deserved their famous victory.",

Royster Harper, the school's vice president for student life, acknowledging that it was \u2018a mistake\u2019 to call off the screening. \u2018The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,\u2019 Harper\u2019s statement read. \u2018We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern. It's back on:\u00a0The University of Michigan nixed an upcoming screening of the Oscar-nominated drama American Sniper over student complaints but quickly did an about-face . The movie was originally set to be shown during a student mixer Friday, but the university decided to cancel the screening over complaints that American Sniper portrays Muslims as villains . \u2018Therefore, the university also will show an alternative movie, \u201cPaddington,\u201d in another location on campus at that same time and date to provide our students with additional options that evening.\u2019 The Michigan Daily originally reported that the Center for Campus Involvement has announced the decision to cancel the showing Tuesday in response to complaints by students about portrayals of Arabs and the Middle East in the film, starring Bradley Cooper as America\u2019s most lethal sniper Chris Kyle. Sophomore Lamees Mekkaoui started a petition earlier in the day after learning that a showing of the film was planned for Friday. Mekkaoui identifies as Arab and Middle Eastern and feels the film \u2018condones a lot of anti-Middle Eastern and North African propaganda.\u2019 The student's petition, which was signed by hundreds of people, described the Navy SEAL sharpshooter, who was shot dead by a fellow Marine at a gun range last year, as a 'mass killer' and 'a racist who took a disturbing stance on murdering Iraqi civilians.' Mekkaoui said that she had seen American Sniper earlier and it made her feel 'uncomfortable.' She suggested that showing the film on campus could incite viewers to violence against Muslims. Not mincing words: Sophomore Lamees Mekkaoui (left) started a petition saying the subject of the film, the late\u00a0Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (right), was 'mass killer' and 'a racist' Taking a stand:\u00a0The school's head football coach Jim Harbaugh responded to the movie controversy by tweeting that his team would watch the film . Instead of American Sniper, the school planned to show the PG-rated Paddington . The student center responded to Ms Mekkaoui's petition by issuing and apology and replacing the R-rated film about the war in Iraq with a PG-rated children's movie about a stuffed bear. On Wednesday, conservative campus group Young Americans for Freedom started a competing petition calling on the Ann Arbor school to show the film, reported Detroit Free Press. 'The movie \u2018American Sniper\u2019 is not about a racist mass murderer or a criminal,' the petition read. 'It is about a decorated American war hero who served his country valiantly. 'If the University prevents a movie like this from being shown, it promotes intolerance and stifles dialogue and debate on the subject\u2026As adults at a public university, we should have the option to view this movie if we so choose and have the opportunity to engage on the topics it presents to come to our own conclusions on the subjects.' The school's head football coach responded to the movie kerfuffle by tweeting that his team would watch the film. 'Proud of Chris Kyle & Proud to be an American & if that offends anybody then so be it!' Coach Jim Harbaugh tweeted late Wednesday night. The high-grossing blockbuster directed by Clint Eastwood was originally scheduled to be shown during a student mixer Friday. Now, American Sniper will be screened separately from the UMix Late Night event, 'in a forum that provides an appropriate space for dialogue and reflection,' the Center for Campus Involvement said in a statement.",

The final followed seven weeks of tough challenges, including the 'chef's table', which involved cooking one of three courses on a menu set up by Italian chef Massimo Bottura. It brings to an end the eleventh series of the popular BBC weekly amateur cooking contest. Mr Wood, a data manager from Oldham in Greater Manchester, served a starter of octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans followed by a main of squab pigeon served two ways with blackberry sauce, watercress puree and carrots. He finished with a dessert of lemon posset topped with seven garnishes \u2013 citrus tutti-frutti, charred grapefruit and orange, a lime tuile, limoncello pistachio crumb, edible flowers, tarragon leaves and a lime air. After he presented the dishes to the judges, Torode said: 'Do you know why I love you? Because you take something quite ordinary and make it special.' Wallace said: 'Simon is brilliant, he's an incredible talent.' After being crowned the winner, Mr Wood said: 'I'm shaking inside, it's so surreal, I can't begin to describe how happy I am. It's life changing.' Finalist Mr Rodd, 33, is an architectural recruitment consultant from London, while Miss Spitzer is the managing director of a luxury travel business and mother to four daughters under nine.

A former MasterChef semi-finalist has become the first woman to run the prestigious Savoy Grill kitchen in its 126-year history. Kim Woodward has been appointed head chef at the famous venue, which has hosted lunches for the likes of prime ministers, musicians and captains of industry for decades. The 34-year-old follows in the footsteps of a string of ma\u00eetre chefs who have headed the kitchen since its opening in the Strand, London in 1889. Ms Woodward, who lives in Camden, said: \u2018It is an absolute honour for me to be the head chef here in one of London\u2019s most iconic restaurants. Obviously there is so much history here, and the people who come through the door come here for the classic dishes that the Grill is famous for.\u2019 At the five-star, art deco Grill, which is now part of the Gordon Ramsay stable, Woodward will head a team of about 35 chefs, of whom some 40 per cent are women.

    "source": "The ex-partner of disgraced Queensland politician Billy Gordon has opened up about the years of abuse she suffered, including three months where she and her children were essentially held hostage and forced to live in fear. The Queensland government was plunged into crisis after when details of the Cook MP's criminal past emerged, leading the Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk to call for his resignation. After Mr Gordon's dark past was revealed he resigned from the Labor party but refused to resign from parliament. Until now, the mother of his two children, Kristy Peckham has been in hiding. The ex-partner of Queensland politician Billy Gordon has opened up about the years of abuse she suffered . Cook MP Billy Gordon was told by Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to quit after the explosive details of his dark past were revealed . She has finally spoken out in an interview with A Current Affair, detailing the domestic violence she suffered through, as well as the disappointment she feels as a result of how the Queensland government have handled the situation. 'I was basically like a hostage to him, I wasn't allowed to go anywhere and there was just so much violence,' Ms Peckham said. 1987: Breaking and entering, and stealing in Innisfail . 1990: Breaking and entering with intent, attempted breaking and entering, and stealing in Atherton . 1992: Breach of probation in Atherton . 1996:\u00a0Public nuisance in Normanton . 1999:\u00a0Breach of bail conditions, stemming from not attending a court summons from the 1996 incident . 2004: Driver's licence suspended for unlicensed driving . 2006: Again, he had his driver's licence for unlicensed driving . 2008: Served an apprehended violence order (AVO) as a result of a complaint by his mother . 'There were times when I was holding our son and he'd hit me and I'd be curled over, trying to protect him.' Ms Peckham said she and her partner started dating in 2001 before finally splitting in 2012. The violence began when she fell pregnant with their daughter and only escalated after their second child, a boy, was born. 'The first time that I actually saw Billy go off he abused me physically. He went off and threw some things around, broke some stuff and it was at that point that I thought 'who is this person and what's going on?',' said Ms Peckham. Their whole relationship was marred by Mr Gordon's controlling, intimidation, obsessive ways and quick temper. 'To me, he's a monster,' said the single mum from North Queensland. She is intensely protective of her children \u2013 the children that she claims her partner never sees. In 2006, she and her two children moved to a home in Dubbo in NSW's central west while Mr Gordon went to Canberra for his political career. Ms Peckham alleges that when he returned to Dubbo his appalling behaviour became worse than ever. For three months she was a prisoner in their home and was prevented from contacting the outside world. 'It was like a sick cycle of three months of hell. We were locked in, the doors were dead bolted, there was security on all the windows,' she said. Ms Peckham alleges that when Mr Gordon returned to Dubbo his appalling behaviour became worse than ever . Until now, the mother of his two children, Kristy Peckham has been in hiding . The phone line had physically been cut to ensure there was no way out for Mr Gordon's trapped partner. 'Unless I threw something through the window and broke the window, I couldn't leave. Even then, he would have caught me before I got out.' The politician has spoken out publicly, denying any allegations of violence. 'That made me very, very angry,' admits Ms Peckham. 'I thought, 'How dare you? You know what you've done!' There are other people that know what he's done too.' Ms Peckham is intensely protective of her children \u2013 the children that she claims her partner never sees . The Queensland government was plunged into crisis after when details of the Cook MP's criminal past emerged . Fortunately, his traumatised partner kept every letter, email and text and now has a damning case against him. A letter written by Mr Gordon in 2006 after his wife finally managed to flee the home serves as a confession of his disgusting abusive behaviour. 'I want to say sorry for the hell I put all through for our time together in Dubbo. I hope in time you can forgive me for the abuse. I've treated you bad and hurt you deep,' the letter reads, according to the Nine Network. 'I've bullied you through our whole relationship. I've acted like an animal.' Although Ms Peckham is now free of her abusive partner, it is a constant battle to receive child support payments from Mr Gordon despite his wealth. In parliament in March, Mr Gordon gave his word that he no longer owed child support. As he made his speech in parliament, he was $24 in arrears. He had owed his wife $5300 in child support just three days before. Knowingly lying to parliament is a criminal offence in Queensland, carrying a maximum jail term of seven years. Today he is still indebted by $732.97. His ex-partner claims he is also lying about his income to the tax office. Ms\u00a0Peckham said her ex-husband still owes\u00a0$732.97 in child support . The violence began when she fell pregnant with their daughter and only escalated after their second child . According to documents, Mr Gordon is registered with the child support agency as only earning $70,000. In actuality the politician earns in excess of $160,000 every year. 'All I care about is my children,' Ms Peckham said. 'He doesn't deserve to have that type of position and power that he's got. 'He should resign.' Ms Peckham doesn't like the way Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk handled the allegations either. She said the premier had never contacted her. 'You've done nothing for me, you've done nothing for my children,' Ms Peckham added. Ms Palaszczuk earlier refused to comment on abuse allegations, but said deceiving parliament was also a very serious issue. 'That's a matter for Member for Cook and that's a matter for people to raise,' the premier said. 'If someone has misled the parliament that is very serious.' Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg called for Mr Gordon to make a full and proper disclosure about the fresh allegations. 'He can't hide behind the police investigation in regards to non-payment of child support or non-return of tax returns,' he said. Ms Peckham said she and her partner started dating in 2001 before finally splitting in 2012 . Mr Gordon hasn't returned AAP's calls, but earlier described the A Current Affair as 'a kangaroo court' Mr Springborg also demanded to know how Ms Palaszczuk was sure Mr Gordon was telling the truth when she questioned him about the allegations. 'How did she satisfy herself about that, did she ask to see the records or didn't she,' he asked. On April 8, as Mr Gordon announced he would stay in parliament, he vowed to take care of his family and right his past wrongs. 'My focus now is on demonstrating to my family, my children and my community that I am a good man and that I will honour their vote for me,' he said in a statement. 'Some people, even MPs, may think they have a perfect past. Mine has not been. I have remorse for past events, but I have learned many lessons since I was a young man. Mr Gordon hasn't returned AAP's calls, but earlier described the A Current Affair program as 'a kangaroo court'. 'Unlike that program and other media outlets, I respect the current police investigation into certain allegations against me,' Mr Gordon said in a statement. 'I will thus make no comment until it is completed.'",

    "source": "Landlord: Despite attacking right to buy, Emily Thornberry has three homes . A senior Labour politician was under fire last night for attacking right to buy \u2013 while renting out a property she bought from a housing association. Emily Thornberry has come out against David Cameron\u2019s pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes. But eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost \u00a31million. Tories said Miss Thornberry, who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in England flags and with a white van outside, opposed right to buy but not \u2018right to buy to let\u2019. \u2018This hypocrisy goes right to the heart of Ed Miliband\u2019s Islington-based, out-of-touch Labour Party,\u2019 said Henry Smith, who is seeking re-election as Conservative MP for Crawley. \u2018They speak out against plans that help the aspirations of hardworking people on days when it\u2019s politically useful.\u2019 Housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, has a\u00a31million home in fashionable Islington, north London. Miss Thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy. And, in a question-and-answer session last week, the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury criticised the policy directly. She said: \u2018I don\u2019t have a problem per se with people being able to buy their council flat or council house, so long as it is replaced like for like. 'And that\u2019s what the problem has been. There has been a massive sell-off but they have not been replaced.\u2019 Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to \u00a3103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties when they become vacant. Each would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The picture that cost Miss Thornberry her job as shadow attorney general was taken during the Rochester by-election, which was won by Ukip. The case highlighted just how much high-value property Miss Thornberry owned. Costly tweet: Emily Thornberry lost her frontbench job after tweeting this picture, with the sneering caption 'Image from #Rochester' while on the campaign trail in Medway, Kent . She lives with her husband, high court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, in a four-storey Victorian townhouse on an exclusive crescent in Barnsbury, north London, worth almost \u00a33million. Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet in November after sneering at a home with St George\u2019s flags hung outside and a white van on the drive. She said she had \u2018never seen anything like it\u2019 after tweeting a photo of the terraced home while on the campaign trail for the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent. The then-shadow attorney general, who lives in a \u00a33million north London house, wrote mockingly alongside the photo: \u2018Image from Rochester.\u2019 At first she tried to defend her remarks but was told to quit within hours of the tweet. The home\u2019s owner, cage fighter Dan Ware, 37, branded her a \u2018snob\u2019. Speaking at the time, leader Ed Miliband said: \u2018Respect is a basic rule of politics and I\u2019m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.\u2019 Miss Thornberry also owns a \u00a3600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she bought for her mother in 2000. In March 2007, her husband bought the housing association property in Finsbury at auction for \u00a3572,000. The three-storey townhouse was bought from Ujima, a housing association catering largely for ethnic minority tenants, which went bust just months later. It is now let. The fact a housing association sells a property does not necessarily mean social housing stock has fallen. They could use the cash to build in a cheaper area. During part of her childhood, Miss Thornberry lived in a council house. At the age of seven, her parents divorced and she and her two younger brothers moved into social housing with their mother. Labour politicians continued to attack the right to buy extension yesterday. David Lammy, a potential London mayoral candidate, tweeted: \u2018Extending right to buy is one of the most senseless and irresponsible pledges ever made by a British political party.\u2019 Last night a YouGov poll for the Policy Exchange think-tank suggested 50 per cent back extended right to buy. Housing fat cat who hates right to buy is a Labour supporter with \u00a31m home . Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a \u00a31million house in Islington, London . The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a \u00a31million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. In reality she has been one of the country\u2019s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an \u2018urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur\u2019, bought a large terrace house in Islington for \u00a3440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than \u00a31million in value. Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend \u2018right to buy\u2019 legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to \u2018some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents\u2019. She added: \u2018We are independent organisations and charities \u2013 you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they\u2019re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.\u2019 Miss Davison\u2019s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: \u2018The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many \u2013 I couldn\u2019t afford to buy my home now. \u2018We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.\u2019",

The disturbing footage sees Thibaud Jean Leon Vallet, 24, and his cousin Jean Mickael Batrikian, 18, use a deodorant can and a lighter to set the marsupial alight in Rottnest Island on April 3. The men told Fairfax Media outside court on Saturday,\u00a0'you think we're monsters? We didn't hurt the quokka. We have pets at home.' Scroll down for video . Video has emerged showing the horrific moment two French tourists set alight an Australian quokka . Using a deodorant can and lighter, the men torch the defenseless creature which quickly scampers away . Both men are heard laughing uncontrollably after igniting the quokka before one said 'Don't do that, why?' The creature survived the incident by scampering away, but was singed by the flame. Both of the tourists pleaded guilty to animal cruelty at Fremantle Magistrate's Court on Friday. They were each fined $4000 and\u00a0will be held behind bars for seven days if they fail to pay the fines. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, Magistrate Elizabeth Langdon commented on their cruelty, calling the offence 'abhorrent.' 'One can only imagine the impact caused to the quokka,' she said. 'Obviously it would have been fearful as a result of what occurred.' The men can be heard uncontrollably laughing after igniting the native Australian creature . The quokka is\u00a0a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick brown fur . Both men were on a working holiday and were spending three months in Rottnest Island working as cleaners. As a result of the incident, both men lost their job. They also had their passports confiscated and are expected to be leaving Australia soon. The quokka, classed by the government as 'vulnerable', is a small wallaby and resembles a diminutive version of the kangaroo with thick, rough, grey-brown fur. It is found only in the south-west of Western Australia state and on the offshore islands of Rottnest and Bald. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

But an entrepreneurial team are hoping their new invention will revolutionise the cleaning of aircraft and help airlines win the battle against bacteria . Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin. Scroll down for video . A father and son team have created a robot, called the Germfalcon, which uses ultra violet light to kill bacteria throughout the cabin . The seats, tray tables and blankets on an aeroplane are breeding ground for bacteria including E.coli . According to the businessmen, germs such as E.coli and MRSA can linger for up to a week on suraces within an aircraft and there are no clear rules on how often aeroplanes should be cleaned. But the family team has developed the unusual new robot as a way to counter issues with cleaning the interior of a plane - which currently only takes place a few times a year. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side. Those wings contain UV-C lamps, which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants. It also has UV-C lamps on its top and sides. Arthur and Mo Kreitenberg, from Los Angeles, said the 3.5billion people expected to fly this year risk falling ill due to poor plane hygiene. Writing on their Kickstarter page to raise money for their project, Mo  said: 'Germs will survive on aeroplane surfaces sometimes for as long as seven days. 'There are no regulations or cleanliness standards for the passenger cabins of airplanes. Aeroplane travelers are at heightened risk of catching the common cold, flu, or more serious infections.' They said their device could spare passengers from catching illnesses when flying and give airlines a competitive edge. Last year a study from the Auburn University in Alabama discovered disease-causing bacteria can survive for up to a week inside plane cabins, on surfaces such as seat pockets, tray tables, window shades and armrests. When the plane is parked and empty, the device, which is the size of a drinks cart, patrols the aisles using motion sensors to navigate itself. As it does, it spreads its two 'wings' over the seats on either side . Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a bacteria that could cause infections, skin disease, pneumonia and sepsis, lived the longest (168 hours). Escherichia coli (E. coli), which can cause urinary tract infection, respiratory illness and diarrhoea, was found to survive for 96 hours. Mo added: 'The industry is growing aggressively. Implementing daily, routine airplane sanitization could disrupt or limit the rate bacteria and viruses spread, as the industry grows. 'We have created an efficient and practical way for airlines to sanitize the interiors of commercial planes between passenger loads. Its wings\u00a0contain UV-C lamps, which are the same type used for disinfection in places like hospitals and water treatment plants. It also has UV-C lamps on its top and sides . Using UV-C light they have have proven a 99.99 per cent germ-kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials . 'Using UV-C light, we have proven a 99.99 per cent germ-kill rate in under 10 minutes with no damage or reaction from any cabin materials. The Germfalcon is programmed to reach the most commonly touched passenger surfaces and kill all germs that are exposed to the robot's sanitising lights.' The robot, which contains settings for sanitising toilets and galleys, also comes with fans and filters to clean the air and suck in dust particles. The Kreitenburgs, who have been working on the robot for several years, are about to start work on their fourth and final prototype before going into commercial production. They are currently seeking sponsorship via Kickstarter and are offering backers the chance to fly on the first completely clean flight.",

The rainbow caves are given their various colours by light refracting through the ice - with the thicker the ice, the more emerald they appear. And a photographer, from Kamchatka, in the Russian Far East, also decided to add his own take - by lighting flares and breathing fire to turn the normally blue hues into dark reds. Scroll down for video . The caves are found near the Mutnovsky volcano, 45 miles (72km) south of the regional capital of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky . The caves, found near the Mutnovsky volcano, 45 miles (72km) south of the regional capital of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, were captured by local guide and photographer Denis Budkov.

Mr Budkov, 35, trekked inside the dangerous caves - which could collapse at any moment - to capture the colourful scenes . The extensive caves, some parts of which have water in them, were first discovered by Mr Budkov by chance . The ice cave's unique formations are created by the heavy winter snow becoming compressed and forming ice. Then as the short, summer months arrive, intensive melting of the ice creates ravines which flow and hollow out the caves and tunnels. The incredible lights shining purple, blue, green and yellow are no computer trickery - they are the result of sunlight streaming through the glacial ice into the hidden world below. The cave was carved out of the glacier by an underground river that is sourced in a hot spring gushing from the Mutnovsky volcano itself.

    "source": "Robert Knowles, 68, is a serial shoplifter who has clocked up nearly 350 offences since 1959 . Britain's most persistent crook with a criminal career spanning 50 years has been jailed again after his 190th court appearance. Robert Knowles, 68, from Plymouth, Devon, is a serial shoplifter who first broke the law when he was 13 and has been in court at least once a year since 1959. The pensioner has broken the law so many times that prosecutors have lost track of his expansive record, which includes 200 thefts and dozens more for other dishonest offences. It is believed Knowles has now clocked up in the region of 350 offences over his lifetime. He pleaded guilty to stealing a watch and a pair of cuff links worth \u00a350 from H Samuel in the city centre at Plymouth Magistrates Court in his most recent offence and jailed for 16 weeks. The court heard he had only recently been released from a six week jail sentence imposed by the same court and was told he must pay an \u00a380 victim surcharge. Knowles, who has spent most of his adult life in prison, had been living briefly in a hostel in Plymouth before the thefts on March 14. Defence lawyers say the pensioner only goes between 24 and 72 hours before he is rearrested after each court appearance. 'Nobody knows why he does it,' his long-term solicitor Alan Harris said. 'Nobody knows whether he is effectively waiting to die in prison.' At a previous court hearing, Mr Harris told magistrates Knowles is an alcoholic who 'recognises himself as institutionalised' and steals to go back to jail. In 2013 he was caught stealing two boxes of chocolate from Thorntons but despite eating the \u00a313 chocolates in the street, a security guard let him off with a warning. He then went to a nearby Tesco Metro and walked out with \u00a326 of food - prompting staff to call police. And in 2011, Knowles admitted stealing two bottles of whiskey, watches and socks worth \u00a3279 from Marks and Spencer. During that hearing at the same court, Mr Harris said: \u2018He can cope very easily with prison but cannot cope very well with the world outside. 'This is as bleak a plea and mitigation as this court can ever wish to hear.\u2019 Knowles left prison six months later and committed another shoplifting offence within a week, this time stealing a watch, sunglasses, underwear and socks worth \u00a379. He pleaded guilty to stealing a watch and a pair of cuff links worth \u00a350 from H Samuel in the city centre at Plymouth Magistrates Court in his most recent offence and jailed for 16 weeks . The Crown Prosecution Service cannot give a full breakdown of his offences because so many of them they pre-date its creation in 1986. Knowles, who was sent to a correctional school in 1959, has been one of several criminals to win the dubious honour of being named 'Britain's most prolific thief'. Those with an even worse record include Bolton kleptomaniac Harry Hankinson, 64 - who in June blamed his 501 crimes on a blow to the head in 1970 which changed his personality. And in March David Archer, from Prestatyn, North Wales, clocked up his 343rd offence - just edging out competition from Knowles.",

The funeral for the murdered Leeton school teacher was held in\u00a0Eugowra, where hundreds gathered to farewell the teacher . Her sister, Kim, shared humorous childhood memories of Ms Scott with the crowd and painted a picture of someone with a strong sense of who she was. 'Steph never cared what anyone thought of her,' Kim said. 'She had an easy way about her that meant she could get along with anyone.' Leeton Shire Mayor Paul Maytom said Ms Scott's mother spoke about her daughter's life and what a big part of the family she was. 'She brought laughter to the family [by playing tricks and telling jokes],' he said. One of the beloved teacher's students, Leeton High School vice captain Grace Green, said Ms Scott - an English and Drama teacher - was an inspiration to her students. Grace, who had been taught by the 26-year-old since Year 8, said she enjoyed her excursions with her teacher, remembering 'fish and chips at Circular Quay' fondly.

Memorials are visible all over the regional town, and most businesses shut down for the afternoon in honour of Ms Scott . Ms Scott's friend Katrina Slattery remembered the teacher as a 'lovely, lovely person' and a 'beautiful friend' Friend Katrina Slattery, 41, who joined the hundreds of mourners on Tuesday, said the teacher would be terribly missed. Ms Scott had lived in Canowindra, from where Ms Slattery also hailed, before she moved to teach at Leeton High School. 'She was a lovely, lovely person. She was a beautiful friend,' Ms Slattery told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's wrecked everyone in Canowindra. They're all feeling the loss. 'There's not a bad word said against her.'",

The Mindfulness for Travel series was developed for launch of the airline's new Airbus A380 service between London and San Francisco, known for its laid-back California vibes. Providing fliers with meditation techniques, as well as additional healthy flying tips, the programme hopes to inspire a relaxed, positive state of mind for all travellers - even if the journey doesn't go exactly according to plan. To celebrate British Airways' new A380 service between London and San Francisco, the airline has launched a mindfulness programme . The airline consulted with mindfulness expert Mark Coleman, also the Founder of the Mindfulness Institute, to develop the recommended practices. Coleman and British Airways created several videos - tailored to pre-flight, mid-flight, and pre-arrival exercises - which will be available on board for all fliers to view. He recommends wearing comfortable clothing, choosing lighter meals on board, moderating alcohol, coffee and tea intake and 'gentle exercising,' such as stretching, during the flight. Coleman also advocates strategic napping to help travellers adjust to a different time zone and feel revitalised upon landing. Along with healthier meal options, the Mindfulness for Travel series is full of tips to ensure a worry-free flight . The brand also tapped mindfulness expert Mark Coleman to develop a series of meditation videos . Coleman recommends 'gently exercising' on board, eating lighter meals and wearing comfortable clothes . 'Embracing the spirit of travel involves living fully in the moment, which can be cultivated through mindful practice,' Coleman said in a statement. 'The video series I created in partnership with British Airways will help travellers develop the clarity, calm and focus necessary to get the most out of their travel experiences.' While undoubtedly it's a bit easier to stretch out and find your inner zen if you're flying in Club World or First class, we'll try just about anything to help us feel refreshed after long-distance travel.",

'He was over 18 yes, but he had the mind of a very much younger person because of his disability, and lots of people didn't understand that and there really needs to be a law just like an amber alert. Police suspect he wandered into Marine Park back in mid-February and got disoriented. The freezing temperatures at the time mean hypothermia could also have contributed to his death.

    "source": "Cuts and wounds in the skin heal in much the same way as a zip being fastened, new microscopic images have revealed. Biologists have studied the healing process at a molecular level using electron microscopes to examine skin as it repairs itself. They found skin cells appear to attach to each other using tiny tubes that then pull them together so they interlock like a zip. This image on the left taken of skin cells healing a wound using an electron microscope show how cells on opposing sides (coloured green and brown) interlock together in a similar way to a zipper used on clothes. The image on the right shows how the would looks on the surface at this stage in the healing process . The researchers hope their findings could help in the development of new treatments for wounds that could speed up this process. Dr Mikhail Eltsov, one of the scientists behind the study at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, said: 'When we look at it from a distance, it appears as if skin cells simply fuse to each other, but if we zoom in, it becomes clear that membranes, molecular machines, and other cellular components are involved. 'Our electron microscope allows us to distinguish the molecular components in the cell that act like small machines to fuse the skin. 'In order to visualize this orchestra of healing, a very high-resolution picture of the process is needed. 'For this purpose we have recorded an enormous amount of data that surpasses all previous studies of this kind.' Dr Eltsov and his colleagues used cells from fruit fly embryos to study the healing processes that take place in skin. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Cell Biology, found that the skin cells on either side of the wound begin by 'sniffing' each other out to find their opposing partners. They then develop adhesive like structure made of microscopic tubes, called microtubules, that pulls them closer together. These attachments work a like velcro and pulls the skin cells towards the opening. Once the cells meet, they use these microtubules as a scaffolding to interlock together like a zip. Professor Achilleas Frangakis, a microscopy expert at Goethe University Frankfurt who led the study, said: 'What was also amazing was the tremendous plasticity of the membranes in this process which managed to close the skin opening in a very short space of time. 'When five to ten cells have found their respective neighbors, the skin already appears normal.' Skin taken from the dead could soon be used to treat wounds in the living. Researchers have found that skin taken from cadavers that is stripped of its cells is effective in healing acute wounds, such as burns, as well as painful ulcers. They believe the new treatment could be used to treat wounds that do not easily heal by themselves, which cost the US alone more than $25 billion (\u00a317 billion) a year. The scientists stripped out the skin\u2019s inner layer \u2013 the dermis \u2013 which contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles and sweat glands, to leave behind its matrix of proteins. The team discovered that \u2018decellulised\u2019 skin provides a scaffold that the recipients own cells can populate and can effectively treat acute wounds, such as burns. Clothing zips, like the one above, hold fast by using interlocking segments and this is how skin closes a wound .",

Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal \u00a0is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner\u2019s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal released today . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help . Another of the fans in a distinctive white and red hat and a man seen tending to one of the wounded as they lay helpless on the football pitch (right) A man in a light denim jacket with long brown hair (left) is another person investigators believe may be able to help. Right, another person pictured in the appeal who was stuck behind the enclosure where fans were crushed . Another fan pictured in the appeal. Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General\u2019s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues. Ninety-six people were killed in the 1989 disaster (above). The conclusions of previous inquests were thrown out in 2012 with the Home Office launching a fresh probe .

    "source": "Blackburn should brace themselves for interest in their players from top-flight clubs following their run to the FA Cup quarter-finals, manager Gary Bowyer has said. Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players . The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows . Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay . Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted. 'He's put himself forward for centre forward on Saturday!' Goalkeeper Simon Eastwood almost scored a late equaliser beyond Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet .",

The Boston RunBase scheduled to open April 16 will allow visitors to learn about the world's most prestigious road race, run a replica of the course on a treadmill or see artifacts from its 118-year history. It will give runners a place to gather before going for a jog by the Charles River, and then shower and change before heading back to work or to the convention center across the street. Construction: Joe Clifford paints the ceiling of RunBase near the 26-mile mark of the Boston Marathon, in Boston on Wednesday . Champion: A gold laurel wreath, which is awarded to the winner of the Boston Marathon, is displayed at the Boston Athletic Association. The wreath, and other historic items from the race, will be on display when RunBase opens later in April . Location: RunBase is just a few blocks from the marathon finish line, and even nearer to the spot where the second bomb exploded during the 2013 race. Runners are seen here during the 2013 Boston Marathon . If they want to pick up a pair of shoes or a Boston Marathon jacket, they can do that, too. 'This RunBase is the front door,' Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said this week before checking in on the construction at the Boylston Street storefront. 'It is intended to be a place where the visitor can touch the history, the tradition of the Boston Marathon, and then get out and do something, go for a run themselves.' A combined effort between the B.A.A., Adidas and longtime shoe-seller Marathon Sports, which is providing the staff and retail know-how, the Boston RunBase is a shoeseum of sorts: part shoe store, part museum. It is the sixth RunBase for Adidas 0 the first in the U.S. But it will differ from locations from Tokyo to Prague, as well as the Nike store nearby, because of its association with the Boston Marathon. 'Not only is the Boston Marathon the Carnegie Hall of running, but Boston is an amazing running community,' said Mikal Peveto, Adidas' director of running innovation. And that became even more apparent after two bombs interrupted the 2013 race, attacks that galvanized runners and turned the Boston Marathon into a symbol of the city's resilience. 'It drew the global running community together over something that's kind of ours, as runners,' Peveto said. 'It changed everything. From something so tragic, it was incredibly powerful what came out of that ... realizing that we had something even more special than we had before.' A running club that had long been associated primarily with its flagship race, the B.A.A. had spent the last 15 years expanding its calendar to include a half-marathon in the fall and a 5K and 10K in the spring and summer. But the organization remained tucked away a few blocks from the course in offices decorated with memorabilia that can be seen, Grilk said, by 'essentially nobody.' Down the street: Boylston Street, the site of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing - as well as the finish line for the marathon itself - is now how to a Boston Marathon-themed store and clubhouse . Legacy: A cyclist pedals over the  finish line of the Boston Marathon on Wednesday. Year-round visitors to Boston have had limited options to learn the history of the race, besides visiting the course, until this month when RunBase opens . Leader: Tom Grilk, the executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, smiles during an interview regarding RunBase . 'We thought: Why not take all this stuff and bring it out to the street?' he said. 'If you can be engaged with the community, you have a chance. You may still screw things up, but you have a chance. Otherwise, you're just the guys who are stopping traffic.' The B.A.A. plans to use the RunBase for special events, including clinics and meet-ups where recreational joggers can connect or get tips from coaches before heading out on a run. Lockers and showers will save them a trip home to change; those staying at one of the Back Bay's dozens of hotels might be sent by the front desk to find a running partner or a good route for, say, a leisurely 5K. The site is about one block after marathon runners turn off of Hereford Street for the final stretch to the finish line, not far from the Charles River Esplanade that is one of the city's prettiest backdrops for a run. It is across the street from the Hynes Convention Center, which hosts a shoulder-to-shoulder runners' expo on marathon weekend and events throughout the year. 'For me, it doesn't matter if it's a dental convention or a running convention,' Peveto said. 'Right outside on Boylston Street, when they walk outside, they're going to see that RunBase.' Much of the memorabilia had been on display in the B.A.A. offices. Other items, like the sweatshirt Kathrine Switzer wore when she became the first woman to enter the race \u2014 and when a race official tried to bodily remove her from the course \u2014 were locked away in drawers. Now they will be included in rotating exhibits, along with records of every Boston Marathon competitor in one place for the first time. 'You could go in there and say, \"Hey, my dad ran this in 1972.\" And click, click, click, you could look up your dad,' Peveto said. Said B.A.A. spokesman Jack Fleming: 'This will be our Ellis Island.' 'When someone participates in the Boston Marathon, they feel like they are added to the honor roll. It's almost like being a part of an alumni association: You just have that connection with the people that have preceded you,' he said. 'And you know that you are following, literally, in their footsteps.'",

    "source": "Kansas has become the first state to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure that critics describe as dismembering a fetus. Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, a strong abortion opponent, signed the 'Kansas unborn child protection from dismemberment abortion act on Tuesday.\u00a0It takes effect July 1. The law bans the so-called 'dilation and evacuation' procedure and redefines it as 'dismemberment abortion.' Sam Brownback, the governor of Kansas, tweeted a photo on Tuesday showing him signing the abortion-ban bill into law . Kansas abortion opponents have spent years pushing their state to the right on the contentious issue, including this 2013 rally at the steps of the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka . Drafted by the National Right to Life Committee, the measure also has been introduced in Missouri, Oklahoma and South Carolina, though only Kansas lawmakers have passed it. 'The Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act is the first of what we hope will be many state laws banning dismemberment abortions,' National Right to Life president Carol Tobias told The New York Times. 'This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States,' she said. Julie Burkhart, the chief executive of the Trust Women Foundation, predicted that her group would challenge the law in court. 'We call it the \"physician intimidation and criminalization act\",' Burkhart told the Times. 'This is unconstitutional.' Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri is also considering a lawsuit. But the governor is holding firm. Brownback has presided over one of the nation's most aggressive pushes to limit abortions, resulting in at least 20 laws restricting the practice of medically terminating pregnancies. 'This is a horrific procedure,' Brownback spokesman Eileen Hawley said. 'He hopes the nation follows suit.' Brownback, a popular conservative governor, won a second term in November despite a bruising campaign largely centered on the state's economy \u2013 not social issues . Kansas state Rep. John Wilson, a Democratic lawmaker from Lawrence, Kansas, is an abortion-right proponent; he asked during a March debate why pro-life groups don't spend more time trying to prevent unwanted pregnancies . The procedure is banned except when necessary to save a woman's life or prevent irreversible damage to her physical health. There is no exception in the law for incest or victims of rape. The new Kansas law specifically explains in graphic language the procedure it bans: . Doctors cannot use forceps, clamps, scissors or similar instruments on a fetus to remove it from the womb in pieces. Abortion rights supporters said the procedure is often the safest for women seeking to terminate pregnancies during the second trimester. The procedure accounted for about 9 percent of abortions last year in Kansas, where most pregnancies are terminated in the first trimester and the state already bans most abortions at or after the 22nd week. 'This dangerous law dictates to qualified physicians how they can practice medicine and treat their patients,' Julie Burkhart, founder and CEO of Trust Women, said in a statement. Brownback signed the bill in a private ceremony at his official residence. His office said he would re-enact it at multiple public events later this month. A photo from Tuesday's ceremony tweeted by the governor's office showed Brownback flanked by anti-abortion leaders and two large photos of fetuses.",

    "source": "Saturday Night Live poked fun at Hillary Clinton just hours before she is set to announce she is running for president, by mocking her decision to tell the world via social media. The former Secretary of State, played by Kate McKinnon, and one of her advisers, played by Vanessa Bayer, discuss how she will declare her intentions at noon on Sunday following years of speculation. The pair decide to record a cellphone video of the Democrat for her campaign launch in a bid to make her come across as soft and approachable, following concerns she will not be able to relate to ordinary voters. During the scene, which includes a cameo from her husband Bill, they insist her second run at the White House will be about the people and not centered around her. But, despite desperate attempts to not be self-centered, Clinton seems incapable of talking about anyone but herself and brushes off her potential competitors. The show took aim at the 67-year-old as she is expected to reveal via video that she is taking another stab at what she believes is 'the highest and hardest glass ceiling'. Saturday Night Live skewered the news that Hillary Clinton would be announcing her presidential campaign on social media this week . The show portrayed the former Secretary of State as aggressive and driven, saying things like; 'Citizens, you will elect me' Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Former US President Bill Clinton at a 2013 event. It is believed she will have a string of celebrity backers for her second White House bid . Barack Obama has already given her his backing by saying he believes she will be an 'excellent president', but the comedians on the NBC show\u00a0latched onto a memo that was made public on Saturday, saying her campaign will be humble and about 'everyday Americans'. After decades in the public eye, and stints in political offices, she faces a challenge showing her more down-to-earth side. On her first try at recording the video she screams in a dictatorial manner: 'Citizens, you will elect me. I will be your leader.' For the second attempt, they try to get Clinton to stop saying 'I' or her name, but she also fails immediately. 'Hello, 'tis I, Hillary Clinton,' she says. The two women are then joined by Bill Clinton (Darrel Hammond), who sneaks up behind his wife as she is filming. He says how grateful he is that camera phones did not exist when he was president - because he would probably be in jail if they were. The former president tells America in his wife's video: 'Hillary would make a great president. And I would make an even greater first dude.' From there they decide to make talk about how difficult the election will be, and the tough challenges Clinton will face from other Democrats. She starts talking about potential rival Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, but the starts laughing, saying: 'He sounds like a Simpsons character.' Her husband makes a second appearance at this point with his saxophone, playing the theme tune to The Simpsons and revealing that he will be his wife's Vice President. He adds that when she dies it will be 'Bill Clinton 2: Bigger and blacker.' After trying to quiet her husband, Clinton gives in and says; 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back.' She then goes over one more problem she has with her adviser - the fact she cannot be her own vice president. Bill Clinton was also featured in the skit, urging America to elect Hillary so he could be her vice president. He adds that he will make a great 'First Dude' Once she formally announces her campaign, Clinton, like all major presidential hopefuls, will no doubt be making an appearance on the show, which this week was hosted by Empire star Tarji P. Henson. However she has been targeted by Saturday Night Live many times before. Just four weeks ago she was skewered on opening sketch following revelations over her personal emails. At the beginning of a mock interview the politician describes herself as a 'relatable woman on a couch'. 'Those emails are as clean as a whistle. What did you think those emails said? 'Hey it's Hilary I really screwed up on Benghazi'.' Former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley took to Twitter on Sunday after the actress playing Clinton compared him to a 'Simpsons character' during the sketch . Referencing her probable run for president, she also insists: 'There will be no mistakes in my rise to the top.' Speaking about the release of the emails, following pressure from her opponents and the media, she says: 'Go ahead, read them, you won't find squat.' When she announces she will likely become the overwhelming favorite to win her party's nomination, with no stiff opponents expected to face her in the primaries. She will inevitably have a number of celebrity backers who will stage fundraisers for her in the coming months with reports suggesting she is looking to raise $1.1billion - double the amount Obama spent on his re-election campaign in 2012. Among them are high-profile Hollywood backers including director Steven Spielberg, and actors George Clooney, Barbra Streisand and Tom Hanks. The November 2016 election will emphasize her plans to address economic inequality and will tout the historic nature of her bid to become the first woman U.S. president, aides have said. 'Who are we kidding? Buckle up America, cause the Clintons are back,' says Hillary in the end of the skit . Clinton will also have to quell a controversy over her work use of a private email account while secretary of state, which Republicans have said is a sign of her penchant for secrecy. Clinton has said she used the single email account for convenience and should have used government email, but violated no rules. Clinton, who lost a heavyweight Democratic nominating battle to Barack Obama in 2008, will announce her campaign on video and social media, a Democrat familiar with her plans said. She will travel later in the week to Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest in early 2016. In a memo made public on Saturday, Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told staff while the goal was for Clinton to win the presidency, the campaign was not about her. 'We are humble: we take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always out-compete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states,' he said in the campaign memo, titled 'We Are Hillary for America.' Many Democrats have eagerly awaited Sunday's announcement since the day in June 2008 when Clinton pulled out of her primary battle against Obama with an expression of regret that she could not crack 'that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time.' Opinion polls show Clinton has a huge lead over potential 2016 Democratic rivals, and few are expected to enter the race. A Reuters-Ipos tracking poll shows Clinton backed by more than 60 percent of Democrats. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of liberals but who says she is not running, is a distant second at 18 percent. So far, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and former U.S. Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose support languishes in single digits in polls, are the most prominent contenders to take steps toward challenging her. Republicans have been gearing up for the battle, and a big field of Republican presidential contenders is expected. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have been the first to formally enter the race, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will jump in on Monday. Clinton operatives have already begun reaching out to top bundlers to urge them to start calling people in their donor networks, a source familiar with the matter said. At least one West Coast bundler began making calls to top donors this past week, and will place another round of calls after the announcement Sunday, the source said. She also intends to sell herself as being able to work with Congress, businesses and world leaders. In New York on Saturday, at the final event put on by 'Ready for Hillary,' a group not connected with her campaign that's worked for the past few years to stoke excitement for it, enthusiastic supporters joined elected officials and local party leaders to celebrate the launch to come. 'After she left the State Department she could have slipped into grandmother-hood, but people want to call her back into public service,' said Jarret Berg, 29, a Democratic staffer in the New York legislature. 'It's time for her.' As her official announcement loomed, the Republican National Committee linked Clinton to Obama, a regular focus of criticism from the GOP. 'All Hillary Clinton is offering is a continuation of the same big government ideas that have grown Washington instead of the middle class,' RNC spokesman Michael Short said in a statement Saturday. 'That's why voters want fresh leadership and a new direction, not four more years of Obama's failed policies.' Clinton (pictured on UN Woman's day on March 10 addressing the email scandal) is expected to be the clear front runner from the Democratic nomination .",

(shout this) and saves so much time as you're covering the leftovers of the pickled pears. Very few people know about them or have them and they always impress when friends use it. SMART BIN BAGS . Very few people will see these \u2013 but that doesn't matter as you're upper-middle class or above and so don't care whether people see it or not \u2013 but a good, solid bin bag is heavenly and you can't imagine going back to the cheap ones now. Deduct a point if you call them some lower-middle euphemistic name like 'refuse sack'. PROPER TEA AND COFFEE CUPS . No politician has been seen with anything but a mug when snapped in their own home since 1997, but tea or coffee from the proper vessel (i.e. one that requires a saucer) is a must for better houses. An extra point if you know the difference between a coffee cup and a demitasse cup. CLOTH NAPKINS FOR KITCHEN SUPPERS . Most people will know to get out the nice napkins (never 'serviettes') for guests but those of better breeding will ensure cloth napkins are set for even the most simple of suppers for one. Knock off a mark if you have ever given a guest a piece of kitchen roll in lieu of a proper napkin. Old fashioned it may be but William says that an Aga is still a good status symbol . William says that a posh household should opt for a cup and saucer (right) over a mug (left) for a hot drink . BATHROOM . A REED DIFFUSER . There's no better smell than fresh air, but for city-dwelling upmarket folk this may not be to hand (or a bathroom may have no windows). A reed diffuser is now just about passable as bathroom d\u00e9cor, but from certain brands only, naturally (The White Company: yes, Next Home: no). A citrus smell, always, for the upstairs bathroom. Never, under pain of death, an Airwick. When it comes to seating William says that fabric sofas are the only way to go . William says that a leather sofa is seen as 'a tad suspect' among the middle classes . PLAIN LOO PAPER . The upper classes would sooner use sandpaper than quilted lavatory roll. Your loo paper must be plain white and un-textured. Three-ply, mind. We're not barbarians. TWO TAPS . Bathrooms in smart old houses will have two taps rather than a 'mono' alternative. These new funky taps are fine for a pied-\u00e0-terre but if your house is older than 1980 then two taps it must be. SOAP . Bar soap. Not liquid. This is non-negotiable. There are even rules when it comes to toilet roll, according to William it should always be white and under no circumstances whatsoever should it be quilted . SITTING ROOM (NEVER 'THE LIVING ROOM') BOOKS TO DVD RATIO . You may award yourself a point if the number of books you own and that are on display outweighs the number of DVDs. Buy 1p copies of the classics online if your shelves are bulging with far too many films (which normally means to have far too much free time, too). A FABRIC SOFA . Leather sofas are always seen as a tad suspect amongst the upper-middles and uppers. Fabric is the only way to go, frankly. SILVER PHOTO FRAMES . There should be lots of these, ideally ones that have been handed down or given to you or family members for landmark birthdays and anniversaries. An extra point if the picture of you meeting The Queen is in one of the smaller ones an tucked away somewhere so discreet you may as well not have it on display. TELEVISION . The rules have shifted for 'the telly' (fine to call it that in an ironic way). Naff TV cabinets to hide the thing are definitely lower-middle and now no-one makes them to fit modern flat screens anyway. Loud and proud, that's what we now want. Yes that's a big old TV and you're not afraid to show it\u2026 although anything over 42 inches is ostentatious. Just up your prescription if you can't see the screen. Deduct a mark, if not four, if you have a cinema room. HOW DID YOU SCORE? 18 - 14: Upper class In the words of Cole Porter, you\u2019re the top! Give your self a good hearty pat on the back and relax with satisfaction (although don\u2019t undo your hard work and go about boasting about this!) 13 \u2013 9: Upper middle Close, but not quite. You can still hold your head up high when inviting pretty much most of the population into your house, but best offer to meet your upper friends in a restaurant or caf\u00e9 somewhere until you sort a few things out. 8 \u2013 5: Middle-middle Nothing to feel ashamed about, although of course you will inside feel deeply anguished at your insecurity within the class food chain. Go and have a soothing cup of tea (from a mug) to calm yourself down. 4 \u2013 1: Lower-middle Let\u2019s say no more about this. Move along\u2026 .",

    "source": "Legendary Barcelona captain Carles Puyol is believed to be training with a view to ending his retirement from football for a lucrative end-of-career spell in Qatar or the United States. Puyol won six La Liga titles and enjoyed three Champions League wins at Barca and is considered to be one of the finest defenders of his generation having been named in UEFA's European team of the year six times across a trophy-laden career. The 36-year-old retired last May after 15 years at his boyhood club having struggled to return from a persistent knee injury, but now reports claim he could be set for a return to playing with New York City or Al-Sadd after returning to training. Barcelona legend Carles Puyol is said to be training ahead of a return to playing in either the US or Qatar . The 36-year-old retired last May after struggling to return from a persistent knee injury that had troubled him . If the reports from Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo prove true, Puyol could join up with Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard in the States or with his former long-term team-mate Xavi, who is expected to move to Qatar with Al-Sadd. The curly-haired centre back had hinted on his retirement that he would consider a return to the game had it not been for the knee injury that plagued the tail-end of his career. 'I don't think I'll be a coach, it's not what I'd like most,' Puyol said in May. 'Maybe I'll change my mind but for now I want to do other things.' Puyol, seen here with\u00a0Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar al-Baker, could move to the Middle East . Xavi, Puyol's former team-mate, is said to considering a move to Al-Sadd and Puyol could join him there . David Villa is now playing for New York City. Frank Lampard will join him soon and Puyol could be next . The former Barca skipper was named as the club's assistant director of football but he left that role in January when Andoni Zubizarreta, his senior, was fired. Xavi visited Qatar in the last international break ahead of a rumoured move at the end of his Barcelona contract which would see the midfield metronome earn around \u00a37million-a-year, and Puyol could choose a similar route. Alternatively, a New York move would see Puyol join the City Football Group alongside Chelsea legend Lampard and another former team-mate of Puyol's, David Villa.",

Arnold Breitenbach of St. George wanted to get 'CIB-69' put on a license plate, the Spectrum newspaper of St. George reported. That would have commemorated both Breitenbach getting the Purple Heart in 1969 and his Combat Infantryman's Badge, according to the newspaper. Service: Vietnam veteran Arnold Breitenbach of St. George wanted to get 'CIB-69' put on a license plate.\u00a0The Utah DMV denied his request, citing state regulations prohibiting the use of the number 69 because of its sexual connotations . Breitenbach had been an armored personnel carrier's gunner during his time in the Army.\u00a0He was inside the carrier's gun turret as rocket-propelled grenades stuck and was left wounded, suffering temporary blindness . The Utah Division of Motor Vehicles denied his request, citing state regulations prohibiting the use of the number 69 because of its sexual connotations, The Spectrum reported. 'While your intended meaning behind the requested plate, CIB-69, is honorable, the Division of Motor Vehicles is required to follow Utah law when approving personalized plates,' Division of Motor Vehicles audit manager Sherri Murray said in a letter to Breitenbach that was obtained by the newspaper. Murray's letter also reportedly said 'Administrative Rule R873-22M-34 is clear regarding the use of \"69\" on personalized plates \u2013 \"69\" formats are prohibited unless used in a combination with the vehicle make, model, style, type, or commonly used or readily understood abbreviations of those terms.

Process: Though Breitenbach appealed to get 'CIB-69' put on his license plate, the appeal was rejected . Honored: Breitenbach has both the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman's Badge . Breteinbach told the Spectum his hearing damage led to his Purple Heart. He also said: 'They've got Viagra (ads) all over the place. I can't imagine myself sitting on the sofa with my parents when I was a little kid having something like that on TV. 'In today's day and age, it seems like everything is out in the open.' The Spectrum reported that Breitenbach was directed to an established appeals process after he contacted Utah's Gov. Gary Herbert seeking assistance, before having his appeal denied in January. Breitenbach told the newspaper he chose not to appeal again and that it wasn't worth the amount of time and money. He ended up getting a Purple Heart logo on a license plate minus 'CIB-69,' according to the Spectrum. A message seeking comment from the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles wasn't immediately returned.",

A war veteran who swapped the battlefield for a 'dull' job as an army recruiter 'raped young hopefuls because it made the job more exciting', a court heard today. Sergeant Edwin Mee, 46, is said to have abused his position of power while interviewing applicants by raping and molesting 11 young women who wanted to join the forces. The officer - known as 'Jock' - allegedly carried out the attacks on women aged from 15 to their early twenties between October 2010 and September 2011 at an Army careers centre in Croydon. The alleged victims, who were desperate for jobs, were often new to the country and unaware of their rights, Southwark Crown Court heard. Mee, who has served in war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three counts of rape and one count of assault by penetration relating to 11 young cadets. Jurors were told earlier in the trial that one of the women, a virgin in her early 20s, fell pregnant after Mee raped her in a locked waiting room. An 18-year-old from Sierra Leone also claimed Mee raped her after saying he could help her get a visa. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC suggested\u00a0'risk taker' Mee who has fought in war zones across the world found interviewing recruits in Croydon 'dull'. 'But if he could use his position and manipulate it to take small risks at first and then bigger ones, it would make the job that much more exciting,' she said. 'Bullying, talking dirty to the young women, smacking bottoms and ultimately raping young women - he got away with it for a year or more. 'He obviously believed he would never get caught.' She said Mee believed he was the only 'real soldier' at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon, south London. 'This case starts and finishes with Sergeant Jock, are you sure that he behaved the way the prosecution said or not - he is right at the centre of it all,' she said. He was British Army recruiting sergeant at Mitcham Barracks in Croydon (pictured) in the Careers and Information Office . 'He, of course, says he didn't do any of the violating, bullying and humiliating acts alleged against him. 'But there appears to be no good reason, or any reason, why any one of these women would lie - let alone 11 of them. 'What have you made of the evidence he gave and of the man whom you are going to be sitting in judgement? 'He is a man who is proud of his record in active service.' Jurors were told Mee thought little of his fellow recruiters, even if they were senior to him. 'He was the real soldier, he was the one who believed that he had the right to recruit those who would join the British Army,' said Ms Cottage. 'You may feel that was his attitude.\u00a0With his promotion towards the end of 2010 did he come to believe in his own importance? 'Was he arrogant enough to believe that when he behaved in the way he did again and again with woman after woman that he had become so important within that office that they would not complain and even if they did, nobody else would believe them?' Mee, originally from Glasgow, joined the army when he was 24 and went on to serve tours of duty in Iraq - where he was attached to the Special Forces. By the time the allegations against him came to light he had acquired the rank of sergeant, and he was suspended in 2011. The court was told that Mee was medically discharged from the Army in April 2014. The alleged offences were initially investigated by the Royal Military Police, before the case was then handed to the Metropolitan Police. The trial continues.

So it is should be of little surprise that their choice of wedding decor has started to influence some of Britain's celebrities. As the preparations for Andy Murray and Kim Sears's nuptials reach the final few days, wedding planners for the couple have been seen carrying trees into Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Saturday's ceremony. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Kim Sears,pictured at the Wimbledon Champions Dinner 2013,\u00a0are preparing to marry in his home town of Dunblane this weekend . The decoration was first seen at the royal wedding in 2011, when trees lined the aisle at the end of each pew in Westminster Abbey. There is less than 48 hours now until the Scottish tennis champion and his girlfriend exchange vows in his hometown. For the last week, the whole town have been getting involved in the celebrations. The inhabitants of the Dunblane have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident, lining the streets with bunting and creating special-themed produce in many of the stories. Trees were wheeled into Dunblane cathedral earlier today ahead of the nuptials . Trees lined the aisle at Prince Williams wedding to Kate Middleton . Am official portrait from the royal wedding in 2011 . Since the Wimbledon champion announced his plans to say 'I do' at the cathedral, there have also been plans to line the streets with well-wishers as the couple make their way to the venue. Messages to the happy couple are in many of the shop windows and several business owners have already sent gifts to either Andy, 27, or his bride-to-be ahead of the big day. Lesley Anderson, 52, who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears six weeks ago and received kind a thank you note which said it was 'gorgeous'. The ivory-coloured piece is hand-embroidered on the inside with the couple's initials and wedding date and was designed by Nicola Ure from K C Bridal specialists in Falkirk. A handmade card featuring Andy and Kim, 27, on the front drawn by local artist Lorna Brown accompanied the garter. Decorations feature in many of the shop windows in Dunblane . Messages and mascots also feature in the town's stores . The card shows Andy in his kilt holding a tennis racket and Kim in her dress along with their Border Terriers. Kim's reply to the gifts read: 'Dear Lesley and all at Point Nouveau Bridal. 'Just a little note to say a huge thank you for the gorgeous gift Nicola made for me. 'It was very kind of you and I hadn't found a garter yet so thanks ever so much. 'Also, that card of Lorna Brown's is absolutely fabulous! It really made us giggle, especially our two little dogs in the background! 'We are really excited for our big day in a month's time and are happy to be celebrating our wedding in Dunblane. 'Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and generosity. Best wishes, Kim Sears X.' Local shops and shop owners are preparing their shop fronts to reflect the great day . Many of the local businesses have decorated their shop fronts with colourful bunting . Lesley Anderson, 52, (left) who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears with a hand-drawn picture of the couple (left). Kim replied with a handwritten note (right . Lesley is close friends with Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, 83 and gave the garter and card to her to take to Kim. She said: 'Out of the blue we got this beautiful card. To be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits. 'I was absolutely delighted. This was such a personal thing. We were really, really chuffed. Andy continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning Wimbledon,  he shook hands with all the shop owners on the Dunblane High street. When Murray, 27, says 'I do' on April 11, the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends. A local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window . Murray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' A sign telling people about parking restrictions around Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Andy's wedding to Kim . Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple will hold their nuptials . Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. For the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town, \u00a0at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck \u2013 so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. Kim shows off her engagement ring at the\u00a0Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it' 'I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to. He added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'",

    "source": "Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are two dynamic leaders at the helm of the world's two most populous nations. And one is particularly vocal about making his mark on history. When India successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around Mars last year, Modi reveled in the moment. \"History has been created today,\" he said. \"We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible. \"The success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation.\" Soon after the galactic feat, he took to the stage at New York's famous Madison Square Garden and received a welcome so rapturous that Jon Stewart called him \"America's First Modi.\" And all along, Modi has issued his call to \"Make in India,\" encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in India where there is a vast talent pool and low-cost production. While Modi's India is out to put its economy on the fast track, China's economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth. President Xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending, while cracking down hard on corruption. And it's been predicted that India could outpace China as the world's fastest growing economy as soon as this year. So is the world's largest democracy primed to overtake the world's biggest single party state as the next economic miracle? OPINION: What India can learn from China . Not so fast, says China watcher and India Today correspondent Ananth Krishnan. \"China is still pulling away from India,\" the Beijing-based reporter said. \"If India grows 7.5% this year and China grows 7.4%, I think it makes a good headline.  But I think people shouldn't get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between China and India.\" China's economy may be slowing down but India faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment, chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure. \"In terms of education, having access to different resources, and job creation, China has done well. It has progressed far better compared to India,\" said Infosys China CEO Rangarajan R. Vellamore. \"Even though there is free movement across the country (in India), the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education.\" In a recent budget, the Modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth. But despite Modi's big pro-business push, India simply can't size up against China's raw economic might. \"After 30 years of dedicated efforts in building China into a manufacturing powerhouse, it would take a long time for India to build that kind of manufacturing capability,\" said Haiyan Wang, Managing Partner of the China India Institute. \"It's not just about lower labor costs. You have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains. You have to have the knowledge. You have to have the skills. You have to be connected to the international market,\" she said. \"So when you ask if India could compete with China, I don't think that is going to be happening -- not in the next 20 years.\" The Indian elephant may be charging ahead, but the sinewy dragon has the muscle to stay ahead. China has the capacity, the connectivity, and the capital to throw its weight around. And being a single party state with no free elections, Xi can march toward a long-term goal without fretting about the next election. But that's not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts, especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region. \"Even if China is putting money into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road fund, it is also building airstrips on reclaimed islands on the South China Sea,\" said Krishnan. \"There no question that India's rise is far less threatening than China's rise.\" With the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in India, the impression of China as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries. \"If you look at India's seven northeastern states, which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure, it's inconceivable for any of those states to allow a Chinese company to come and build roads,\" said Krishnan. So when Modi touches down in Beijing next month for his second meeting with Xi, can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business? \"As pragmatic as President Xi is, as pragmatic as Prime Minister Modi is, economic integration is going to happen regardless of 100% trust or not,\" said Haiyan Wang. Eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders, the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance. \"If these two countries come together, 40% of the world's people are going to be prosperous,\" said Vellamore. \"If they are able to come together, there can be a new kind of world order in the entire region which is going to benefit all of Asia.\" It's a moment for both leaders to make a lasting mark on history.",

Wilshere was joined by other injury plagued first team players including German forward Serge Gnabry and long-term absentee Abou Diaby who managed to last 56minutes as his own return gathered pace. However, it was the Royals who claimed victory after former Arsenal defender Martin Keown's son Niall scored the eventual winner with a header in the opening minutes.

Scorer: Keown 8' This top-of-the-table Under 21s clash was supposed to showcase Arsenal's next generation of talent but it was a name from the past who stole the plaudits. Keown rose highest to head home Liam Kelly's corner past Gunners keeper Matt Macey after only eight minutes. The visitors were unfortunate not to double their lead through\u00a0Tariqe Fosu only minutes later when his his curled effort skewed just wide. The Gunners pressed for an equaliser before the break with Gnabry slicing wide from 10yards out before Wilshere saw a decent strike saved by Reading keeper Daniel Lincoln. Wilshere became more and more influential when the game resumed after the interval - finding Alex Iwobi following a typical surge from midfield only for the forward's shot to be well saved. Daniel Crowley also impressed as Arsenal tried to get off the markt, he almost set up Wilshere in the latter stages but the England international's low strike could not find a way past the impressive Lincoln.

Scar Booth, which is available from the Apple iTunes store for 79p, offers a gallery of 77 wounds - purportedly real ones - and its makers boast: 'Your friends and family will be convinced that you have suffered a painful beating.' Anti-violence charities have hit back at the disturbing app for trivialising, or 'glorifying' abuse and brutality. Scroll down for video . Disturbing: Scar Booth, which I tested out myself (pictured), offers a gallery of 77 wounds - purportedly real ones - which can be superimposes onto selfies so you can 'prank' friends and family, according to the app . BulliesOut, a Cardiff-based anti-bullying charity, hit out at Scar Booth via Facebook, stating: 'People have to live with real scars... from self-harming, and suffer cuts and bruises from being bullied. 'This app makes a mockery of their injuries and what they have been/are going through.' Adam Fouracre, founder of violence prevention charity Stand up to Violence, concurred. \u2018It\u2019s a very negative thing about the society we live in if people think this sort of thing is fun or funny,' he said. According to the app's description, issued by its developer Appdicated, its main purpose is to prank friends and family. 'Load any picture and add virtual wounds to the photo, adjust the transparency of the image to make it look like it is a real injury. [It] will FREAK out just about anyone who sees it.' Mr Fouracre, who launched Stand up to Violence in 2005 after his brother was beaten to death in a random, violent attack late at night, insists it 'glorifies violence'. He argues: 'When people see these pictures they are going to be heartbroken and thinking something really is wrong.' Not so hilarious: The app's description reads, 'Your friends and family will be convinced that you have suffered a painful beating' Backlash: Anti-violence charities have accused the app of 'making a mockery' of abuse and 'glorifying violence' Appdicated founder Rory Boyer defended the app, stating: \u2018Scars and bruises do not have to come from violence and this app was created to prank friends and not to glorify violence.\u2019 Although the app is not intended for use by those under the age of 17, photos exist on Twitter of at least one young boy posing in his pajamas with the app's injuries covering his face, captioned: 'My face has been injured. Help Me'. And one iTunes review reads: 'I had so much fun mutilating myself and the rest of my family. I sent them to fb & fooled everyone.' Mr Boyer insists that his company has not been contacted by a single anti-violence charity and says any concerns over the suitability of the app are 'very surprising to hear'.",

With around 20 tradespeople dying each week as a result from past exposure to asbestos too, it's far from the rapidly dwindling issue many presume it to be. That's why award-winning artist Joe Joiner, from East London, whose great-grandmother died after being exposed to the substance, has created a moving new art installation in tribute. Over 5000 people die from asbestos-related diseases each year, making it a bigger killer than road accidents . Over 50 families, all grieving for a loved one lost to asbestos exposure, have contributed heartfelt messages to a new moving artwork to help raise awareness, unveiled this week in Covent Garden, London . Currently on display in Covent Garden, London, the installation is made up of heartfelt messages from people who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related diseases. Many are widows whose husbands were exposed during trade work, children who have lost fathers, and others mourning wives, mothers and grandparents. Over 50 families have contributed to the art project, with personal messages to their departed. Created as part of HSE\u2019s Beware Asbestos campaign, the artwork is made up of two huge glass boxes, inside which the messages float around representing a breathing pair of lungs. Award-winning artist Joe Joiner, from East London, has created the art installation as part of\u00a0HSE\u2019s Beware Asbestos campaign. Joe, whose great-grandmother died after being exposed to asbestos while working at a factory, revealed he initially thought it was a last-century phenomenon. However, while talking about his project with friends and family, more and more cases made themselves known . The messages, written on pieces of paper, are symbolic of the microscopic asbestos fibres inhaled by those exposed. Causing deadly diseases including mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer, asbestos can be a deadly killer to those unaware of its presence. Among the contributors is Lauren Ross, 56, from Didsbury, Manchester, who lost her husband Frank in 2007. Lauren Ross, 56, from Didsbury, Manchester, lost her husband Frank, a shop fitter and joiner, in 2007 to\u00a0mesothelioma, an aggressive form of lung cancer caused by exposure to microscopic asbestos fibres . Mrs Ross joined other widows and families who have lost loved ones to asbestos-related diseases at the unveiling of the art installation in Covent Garden, London. She has vowed to continue raising awareness . A \u00a0shop fitter and joiner for most of his life, Frank died of\u00a0mesothelioma aged 60, just a year after he was diagnosed with the condition. 'He first felt a pain in his side on holiday at the end of August 2005 and was treated at first for a pulled muscle,' recalls Mrs Ross. 'In January, he was sent for a chest X-ray due to the pain and some shortage of breath. Poignant: The messages in the installation are symbolic of the microscopic asbestos fibres inhaled by those exposed . 'He was told on 13 January what they thought he had and had further tests from there. He died a year later in February. 'What really upset Frank was the fact that he must have been bringing asbestos into our house for years, potentially affecting me and our four children,' she added. 'This was something he had absolutely no idea about.' Created as part of HSE\u2019s Beware Asbestos campaign, the artwork is made up of two huge glass boxes, inside which the messages float around representing a breathing pair of lungs . Despite experiencing a great deal of pain, Frank continued to raise awareness about the risks of asbestos, and necessary measures to protect workers. 'Since his death I am determined to continue his work in raising awareness, and also to make it clear to tradespeople that - unless you follow all the necessary safety procedures - there is a chance you are taking asbestos home to the ones you love,' says Mrs Ross. 'I want people to be aware that deaths from exposure to asbestos are not a historic issue, but something that can happen to anyone today if the appropriate measures aren\u2019t taken.' Over 50 families have contributed to the art project, with personal messages to their departed loved ones .",

In the programme, she describes how she was waiting for the bus home in the Beeston area of Leeds last month. She was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone before being raped and left for dead . In the programme, she describes waiting for the bus home when\u00a0she\u00a0was grabbed by the man, who is still at large, and pushed into the garden. There she was bludgeoned several times over the head with a large stone\u00a0before\u00a0being raped and left for dead. The victim told Crimewatch: 'Then it was getting dark. I went to the bus\u00a0stop. I was waiting for a bus to go home. 'I haven't been able to stop thinking about what happened. I've stopped sleeping because I can see what happened when I am trying to\u00a0sleep.' He is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, in his early twenties and slim with a receding hairline. West Yorkshire Police are treating the crime as a rape and attempted\u00a0murder,\u00a0and are scouring the area for clues as to his whereabouts. This is the blood-stained rock used by a rapist to hit his 18-year-old victim over the head 20 times before sexually assaulting her in a harrowing attack . A map showing the areas of Leeds, where the rapist had been stalking women on the night of the attack . CCTV from earlier the same evening on March 6 shows a man of the\u00a0same description stalking three other women elsewhere in the city.

The morphed image uses the previous e-fit and the description given by one\u00a0of\u00a0the women he was caught following. Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen said: 'We believe this new image is\u00a0the\u00a0most realistic likeness we have yet had of the man we are still working\u00a0very\u00a0hard to identify. 'It has been created from the victim's description of him and from the\u00a0recollection of one of the women he stalked in the period leading up to the\u00a0attack. 'I would ask people to study it very closely alongside the other elements\u00a0of\u00a0description that we have already released and think hard about whether they\u00a0know who it is.' In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her . This chilling footage was released by West Yorkshire Police in a bid to trace the man who is wanted for rape and attempted murder . The Crimewatch team filmed in Leeds last week using actors to re-account\u00a0the\u00a0harrowing events, including the areas where the three other women has been\u00a0stalked. The reconstruction, which airs on Crimewatch at 9pm, will include\u00a0information\u00a0from the victim's police interviews and comments made as she tries to\u00a0recover\u00a0from her ordeal. Det Supt Wallen added: 'This was an appalling attack on a young woman where\u00a0a\u00a0shocking level of violence was used which could so easily have had fatal\u00a0consequences. 'It has understandably had a very significant traumatic effect on the\u00a0victim\u00a0and that clearly comes across in the emotive comments she has made which feature in tonight's Crimewatch programme. 'We are very grateful to the local and national media for all the support\u00a0they\u00a0have given our ongoing appeals over the last seven weeks. 'Crimewatch is however a particularly prominent platform for the appeal and\u00a0we\u00a0are hoping that among its millions of viewers tonight could be someone who\u00a0has\u00a0that crucial information that could help us to identify this man.' The detective added: 'We are hopeful that the woman shown being followed,\u00a0who\u00a0we have not yet identified, will come forward as a result of this new\u00a0appeal. 'Although we are now seven weeks into this investi gation, our resolve to catch\u00a0this man remains as strong as it was on day one.

In a leaked memo from the firm's Angela Ahrendts, the retail chief said that customers won't be able to buy an Apple Watch in store 'through the month of May' due to 'high global interest combined with our initial supply.' It was expected to launch on 24 April. Ms Ahrendts added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets 'closer to in-store availability.' Scroll down for video . In a leaked memo from Apple's Angela Ahrendts the retail chief wrote: 'Due to high global interest combined with our initial supply, we are only taking orders online right now [and] we expect this to continue through the month of May.'\u00a0It was expected to launch on 24 April . The memo was seen by Rhiannon Williams at The Telegraph. Pre-orders of the watch began on Friday\u00a0at 12.01am PDT (8.01am BST) and within an hour many models in various regions had sold out including the most expensive 38mm gold Edition version in the US and Canada. Models were showing a shipping time of four to six weeks or, in some cases, June despite the watch going on general sale on 24 April. An estimated 957,000 American shoppers ordered Apple Watches on Friday. That estimate comes from Slice Intelligence, which measures digital commerce by tracking consumer e-receipts. Its data from online shoppers showed an average of 1.3 watches bought per customer, with $503.83 (\u00a3337) spent per item - although Apple has not officially confirmed any sales figures. In a recent Goldman Sachs survey, more than 10 per cent of iPhone owners say they will buy an Apple Watch, a new survey has found. Goldmach Sachs surveyed 1,000 people, and found 11% of people who own an iPhone are 'very likely' to buy the $349 smart timepiece this year. It said the demand for the Watch was 'encouraging', and says sales are likely to hit hit traditional watch firms. It was initially believed that those who were willing to queue on 24 April would be able to buy the Watch before people who had pre-ordered. But Ms Ahrendts memo has confirmed otherwise. 'It's important to remember that Apple Watch is not just a new product but an entirely new category for us,' the memo continued. 'There's never been anything quite like it.  That's why, for the first time, we are previewing a new product in our stores before it has started shipping. 'Given the high interest and initial supply at launch, we will be able to get customers the model they want earlier and faster by taking orders online.' She added that this isn't the way Apple intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves 'those blockbuster Apple product launch days', but told store employees to be prepared for the changes. On Friday many buyers reported Apple's site was still down after the launch time, forcing them to order the device through the Apple App Store on their phones or tablets. As part of the first wave of pre-orders, the Watch can be bought online by people in\u00a0the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia, Hong Kong, China and Japan. The Watch also went on display in Apple stores across these regions, as well as in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, Isetan in Tokyo, Selfridges in London, and select Apple resellers in Japan and China. Online pre-orders began on Friday at 12.01am PDT (8am BST) and although Apple said the devices will ship on 24 April within just an hour this had been pushed back to June. Buyers also reported the site was still down after the launch time, forcing them to order the device through the Apple App Store app . Ms Ahrendts added it had not been an easy decision and would provide more updates as the firm gets 'closer to in-store availability.'\u00a0It was initially thought those who were willing to queue on 24 April would get the Watch in stores before people who had pre-ordered. But Ms Ahrendts' memo has confirmed otherwise . 'Will the Apple Watch change your life? Well, possibly more than many realise until they start using it. 'After a day or two with the watch, a strange thing happened - I completely stopped checking my phone. 'While Apple may be the firm that really creates phone addiction, meaning we are constantly checking our handsets, with the Apple Watch it may have cured it. 'Apple undoubtedly has another hit on its hands with the watch. 'As more and more apps appear, and developers actually get to spend time with it, I fully expect it be used in ways we can't even imagine now. 'Much like the iPhone, apps could propel this to become a new computing platform - and even with the features it already has, the Apple watch is the most elegant way to communicate digitally.' Mark Prigg in New York . As with all Apple launches, the Californian tech giant took its store offline hours before the pre-order time to update its product pages. However, shortly after the pre-orders opened customers took to Twitter to complain the site was still down and they couldn't access the checkout. One said: 'Irritated that I stayed up until 3AM to pre-order an #AppleWatch and the site was down until after the May inventory already sold out.' And even after orders had been placed, some customers had trouble receiving confirmation details and delivery dates. One Twitter user wrote: '#AppleWatch\u00a0ordered but no email confirmation and the 'orders' section on their site and app is down so I can't confirm it went through.' Another wrote: 'No way in hell am I preordering an #AppleWatch today when it won't ship until June.' and another added: 'There's an #AppleWatch for everyone.' Unless you want it before June.' But for people who want to try on the Watch they can book an appointment online. A MailOnline investigation earlier this week revealed that the UK is the most expensive place in the world to buy the majority of Apple Watch models. Apple's site and app still say the Watch is available from 24 April, but when a model is selected and added to the customer's online basket (pictured), this changes. A Sport model currently has a dispatch time of four to six weeks, while the Edition model has a June delivery date . And for people who want to try on the Watch  they can book an appointment online (pictured). The memo added this isn't the way Apple intends to launch all new products form now on and it loves 'those blockbuster Apple product launch days' but told store employees to prepare for the change . The most expensive Edition model costs up to \u00a32,500 more in the UK compared to elsewhere in the world, while at the lower end of the scale British buyers pay up to \u00a363 more for the Sport model. The cheapest model is the 38mm Sport version and costs \u00a3299 in the UK. In the US, the same model costs $349, but this doesn't include sales tax. Sales tax in the US depends on the region where the product is sold, but as an example California has one of the highest rates - at 9% - while Montana has zero. All prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region.\u00a0Prices also include all relevant sales taxes. Beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in GBP. In the US, California was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9%, while Montana was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it doesn't have a sales tax. Quebec in Canada has one of the highest sales taxes at 15%, while Alberta has one of the lowest at 5%. Prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing. With both of these sales taxes added to the price of the Sports model in the US, the total cost works out at $380.41 (\u00a3257) and $349\u00a0(\u00a3236) in the respective states. This is a difference of \u00a342 when bought in California, compared to the UK, and \u00a363 when compared to Montana. The effect is magnified for the top-of-the-range Edition version, which costs from \u00a38,000 for the 38mm model in Britain, compared to a starting price of $10,000 in the US. At the time of writing, $10,000 converts to \u00a36,769 - which equates to a difference of \u00a31,231 before charges are taken into account. The most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the UK is \u00a313,500 in the UK, and $17,000 in the US. When sales taxes are added to the US model, the price rises to $18,530 in California, which converts to \u00a312,543 - a difference of \u00a3957.",

    "source": "As Gwyneth Paltrow files for divorce from  Chris Martin, the couple whose split made them 'closer than they ever have been' are still confounding their critics by playing nicely. Even if you thought their 'conscious uncoupling' was a load of Goop from Gwyneth, it was a refreshing change from the vicious slanging matches other celebrities engage in after a split. There are lessons to be learnt from the couple on how to split amicably - and how to stay friends with an ex. Scroll down for video . Tracey Cox says that Gwyneth and Chris' amicable split is refreshing and something we can learn from . HOW THE COUPLE GOT IT RIGHT: . Put your kids needs first . Gwyneth and Chris are sharing equal custody of their two children and always maintained their first and foremost priority is to make Apple and Moses happy. No matter how acrimonious the split or how little you now have in common, if you have children together you will always have one shared goal: to bring your children up to be happy, functional adults. The more you both focus on that and think of what's best for the children, the more chance you have of forging a geniune friendship. If you're friendly enough to have 'family dates' where you all go out together now and then, do it. But only if you're both relaxed in each other's company. The point is to let the children see there are no hard feelings and that you both have their best interests at heart. If you spend the whole time sniping at each other with pasted, fake smiles, there is no point. Don't criticise their new partner . Gwyneth openly praised Jennifer Lawrence when he dated Chris and he's said to be supportive of her dating choices. Nothing looks more dignified or signals you really are moving on than giving your ex's new love the thumbs up. It instantly scores points with the new person in their life, making them feel less threatened and less likely to want to sabotage, and paints both of you in a good light. If you applaud their current choice in partner, you're effectively saying they had good taste in the past (when they chose you!). Focus on what you liked about your ex at the start, not what drove you apart at the end . Sure, Gwyneth posting a sweet picture of her and Chris in a field with a heartfelt explanation of why they were separating, did provoke a 'Seriously?' reaction. But the sentiment behind it sent a very clear signal: don't expect us to be bagging each other. 'Normal' couples can do the same by letting mutual friends and family know that there is no reason to take sides because you aren't interested in bad-mouthing each other. You might not want to swap 'parting gifts', like Chris and Gwyneth are rumoured to have, but a card expressing disappointment that it didn't work and wishing them well for the future is a nice gesture, if you really do mean it. Talk face to face or on the phone to sort out anything tricky . Chris and Gwyneth regularly talk on the phone to make sure wires don't get crossed. Communicating by text or through social media is fine once you've established a friendship but if you're both still raw and hurting, it's easy to read things into innocent comments. Tracey says that although Gwyneth and Chris' split is admirable there are some aspects you should steer clear of . You can pick up a lot from someone's voice; even better when they're in front of you and you can read their body language. DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME: . You do need a separation period . Chris and Gwyneth were pictured together frequently from the moment the split was announced. But most couples need a period where they separate without too much contact to break the 'we' habit and become two 'me's'. If you're too close, you'll end up being one of those couples who live apart but remain co-dependent, relying on each other for everything they used to. This is fine if you both aren't interested in meeting new partners, but few people feel comfortable intruding on this sort of situation. Don't give your children (or your ex) false hope . Chris and Gwyneth's separation has been so fairytale, the media was predicting a reconciliation practically every week. The same can happen to you. If there's too much tenderness and affection, everyone around you that has a vested interest in you reconciling is given hope. It's also not uncommon for exes who are now being nice to each other, to suddenly remember what it was they fell for in the first place and want to try again. If you're open to that, by all means go for the Chris/Gwyneth style of separating but if you know you'll only ever want to be friends, spell that out. Get the financial settlements out the way first . Gwyneth and Chris are both worth roughly the same (\u00a3100m each), so have sensibly decided to split their fortune straight down the middle. Most couples don't earn the same amount (let's not even go there on how much less we're all worth) so do experience friction over finances during the negotiation period. Your friendship has more chance of working if you're polite and fair while you're getting the messy stuff out of the way and attempt more frequent contact once it's sorted. DON'T ATTEMPT BEING FRIENDS AT ALL IF: . The break-up wasn't mutual and you have a hidden agenda . If you're utterly heartbroken, being friends will be painful and pointless. Doing it so you can keep tabs on what they're up to also isn't the best idea you've had. It increases jealousy, upset and anxiety over the break rather than relieves it. You weren't even great friends when you were together . If you spent your entire relationship ripping each other apart why on earth would you want to stay in contact? They're your back-up person . If you were the one to initiate the split but aren't sure you've done the right thing, staying friends is keeping them on the back burner. If you decide you can't get any better, you can get back together, right? Not only isn't this fair to your ex, it's not fair to you either. Leaving the door half-open means everyone new you meet gets compared to them. But exes are exes for a reason - they didn't suit you. If you weren't right together, wipe the slate clean and move on and you'll be more open to meeting a new type of person who will make you happy long-term.

    "source": "The sheriff who had former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez in custody for more than 18 months said Tuesday that he's a master manipulator and will probably do fine in prison now that he has been sentenced to life for murder. Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Hernandez knows how to use his charm and manipulate better than anyone he has ever seen, adding that the former football star is generally affable and polite and would try to use those qualities to get what he wanted at the Bristol County House of Corrections. 'He would make every effort to get extra sandwiches,' Hodgson said. 'He would just try to convince the officers to give him more than what they otherwise could get.' Scroll down for video . Former New England Patriots NFL football player Aaron Hernandez during his trial for murder (file photo) Staff members were directed to treat Hernandez like any other inmate, Hodgson said. Hernandez was convicted April 15 of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. He will ultimately end up at the maximum-security Souza-Baranowski state prison. A lawyer for Hernandez did not immediately return messages seeking comment on the sheriff's remarks. After the verdict was delivered, staff from Bristol County brought Hernandez to a state prison not far from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play football in front of tens of thousands of cheering fans. There, he told them, 'I'll miss you guys, but they got it wrong,' Hodgson said. 'He didn't really have much of a change in his demeanor. He pretty much still had a swagger in his step.' Hodgson said the 25-year-old Hernandez has an ability to compartmentalize things and lock out the negative. 'He doesn't really look at it as jail,' Hodgson said. 'It's more like training camp.' Hernandez got into trouble from time to time in jail in Bristol County. He was accused of threatening to kill a prison guard and his family, and he got into a fight with another inmate. Asked how he thinks Hernandez will do in prison, Hodgson said he thought he'd be OK. 'He'll probably do fine. He'll be able to talk his way through everything,' Hodgson said, adding that disrespect is a 'hot-button' issue for Hernandez. 'If someone's trying to outwardly and aggressively disrespect him, that could create a problem,' said Hodgson. Hodgson said he had many conversations with Hernandez about his father, who died unexpectedly when Hernandez was 16, with Hernandez telling him how his father commanded respect whenever he walked into a room. 'His father was a huge, huge influence in his life and really his anchor,' Hodgson said. 'If you disrespected him, it's like you disrespected his father.'",

    "source": "Decided? Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage . Ruth Bader Ginsburg has already made up her mind about gay marriage, a report has claimed, ahead of a landmark Supreme Court hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide. The famously liberal justice, who is 82, will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same-sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states. Ginsburg, who has sat on the court since 1993, has been unusually open about her opinions ahead of the cases. cutting against a long-held tradition of not speaking out in advance. The new report, Yahoo! Politics, cited interviews in which Ginsburg has referred to the American public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same-sex ceremonies. Ahead of the first such ceremony, held in Washington, D.C., \u00a0in August 2013, she told the Washington Post\u00a0that she understood the symbolic implications of her involvement. She said the wedding, of her friend\u00a0Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, to economist John Roberts, would 'be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship.' She will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of Obergefell v. Hodges, for which arguments will be heard from Tuesday and a decision is expected this summer. The case is being brought by James Obergefell, an Ohio man who married his husband in Maryland but was not allowed to name himself as spouse on his husband's death certificate in his home state. Currently 37 states allow gay marriage, as well as Washington, D.C. - but Ohio is one of 13 which has held out. Protests: Pictured are gay rights protesters camped out in front of the Supreme Court this weekend.\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges will be heard from tomorrow . Votes: Ginsburg is one of four liberal-voting Supreme Court justices, though Anthony Kennedy (front row, second from right) has often sided with them on gay rights issues. Pictured above are all the Supreme Court Justices. On the front row (left to right) are Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, John G. Roberts, Kennedy and Ginsburg. Behind them (also left to right) are\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Sameul Alito and Elena Kagan . The Supreme Court will determine whether the Constitution guarantees all citizens the right to same sex marriage, which could void all the remaining bans. And if it determines that recognizing gay marriage is still up to individual states, the court could also decide that states are obliged to recognize gay marriage performed elsewhere in the U.S. After a 2012 ruling, the federal government is already required to recognize gay marriage in states where they are allowed. The liberal wing's four justices are expected to vote in favor of gay marriage, and could be joined by the more conservative Anthony Kennedy, who has often sided with liberals on issues of personal freedom, which would provide the five votes necessary for a majority. In an interview with Bloomberg\u00a0earlier this year, Ginsburg insisted that 'it would not take a large adjustment' for Americans to accept gay marriage across the board, and that the country has become far more accepting. Gay marriage opponents have said that Ginsburg previous actions and public statements go so far as to make her unfit to hear the case. Battle: The case was prompted by James Obergefell, left, who wants the state of Ohio to recognize him as his husband's spouse on his death certificate. He is taking on Richard Hodges, right, who leads Ohio's department of health . Couple: Obergefell, left, married his husband John Arthur in Maryland shortly before his death - but has not been allowed to name himself as Arthur's spouse on his death certificate . Both the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association, which oppose gay marriage, have demanded that Ginsburg remove herself from the case because she officiated over the ceremony. They made the same demand of Justice Elena Kagan, another liberal justice, who has officiated a ceremony as well. If both justices were to agree it would leave the court two liberals down and unlikely to side with the legalization. However, according to legal scholars, neither has done anything wrong because the earlier court decision had already vindicated same-sex marriages in states which had legalized them. It has been speculated that Justice Kennedy could be the swing vote in this issue. A recent report by the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0speculated that his professional links with a California law school dean who hired him in the 1950s could have embedded some early sympathies. The report, citing people who knew him when he taught at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said that being mentored by Gordon Schaber, who never married and was widely thought to gay, could swing him towards favoring gay rights. Kennedy is likely, the report said, to eventually write the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which would follow several other written opinions expanding gay rights.",

Rappers Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus mid-performance on Saturday night and taken into custody.

Authorities said that they suspected the music stars were in possession of drugs when 'a very potent smell' of marijuana was detected coming from their two tour buses. When Migos left to perform at Georgia Southern University's Hanner Fieldhouse arena over the weekend, investigators seized the opportunity to conduct a search. Multiple guns, marijuana and another undisclosed drug were discovered inside the vehicles,  officials said. They added that the discoveries 'were intensely concerning' as they had been brought to a university-sponsored event where over a thousand students were congregated. In the spotlight: According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not fulfill their upcoming tour dates . Bad habits? Migos pose with friends for a group photo, posted to social media . The three band members - best known for their 2013 single Versace and their 2014 track Fight Night - were arrested after leaving the stage. They reportedly face charges of drug possession; possession of firearms in a school safety zone; and possession of firearms during the commission of a crime. It wasn't known early Monday if they had attorneys. Phone calls and emails to the group's management team by the Associated Press were not immediately returned. About a dozen other suspects - all occupants of the two vans - were also taken into custody following the concert. Information about them and the charges they face were not immediately available. The arrests took place during the school's annual spring concert. Migos - which formed as a group in 2009 - had contracted with Georgia Southern to perform at the event, the sheriff's office said.",

Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard)\u00a0was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'",

An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. The craft was supposed to be capturing footage of the Royal Burgers Zoo chimp enclosure for a TV show. Watch the video here . Look out! An Arnhem TV station has lost one of its expensive drones after a chimpanzee managed to knock it out of the sky. Following the attack, the drone crashes to the ground - only for the chimp to pounce on it . 'On the morning of Friday, April 10, 2015, the chimpanzees of Royal Burgers' Zoo once again proved how intelligent they are,' a spokesman for the zoo said. The incident happened during filming for a reality show set in the zoo. Programme makers had hoped to use the drone to capture the enclosure from above. 'Today, for the second season of the national television program Burgers' Zoo Natuurlijk, film takes were planned with a drone, with which spectacular images of the animals and their habitats could be made from above.' The drone was able to fly around the zoo - before arriving at the chimp enclosure. 'Once the drone arrived at the chimpanzee quarters the intelligent primates immediately discovered the spying little plane and right away armed themselves with long sticks against this inquisitive electronic intruder,' the zaoo revealed. One of the chimpanzees was high up in a tree with a long branch. 'Apparently very calm and satisfied, half asleep in the morning sun, the primate let the drone make its curious images. 'Until..... the drone got just a bit too close. Once grounded, the chimp investigates its prey, taking a selfie in the process - before eventually wandering off. 'Like a flash the chimpanzee struck out with the long stick she had held hidden behind her body. With a direct hit the animal knocked the drone to the ground, where the group of primates quickly overpowered the 'prey'. 'With much enjoyment they very efficiently dismantled the play thing. 'During the entire moment of action the camera kept rolling, so despite the completely destroyed drone this still provided some very special images!' The zoo did not confirm if it was able to salvage the drone.",

Sarah Jewell, 25, is still living and breathing, a fact she proved when, after the IRS told her to contact her local Social Security office in Sparta, she walked right in and announced 'I'm alive!' The staff told Jewell that someone had filed her Social Security number as deceased in November 2014. Jewell said the office implied she would be fine and that 'everything's taken care of'. Sarah Jewell, 25, was expecting to find a tax refund in her mailbox when she instead received a letter from the IRS informing her that she had 'died' But fast-forward three months later and Jewell said she hasn't received instruction from Social Security on how to proceed and her number has yet to be reinstated - leaving her life in total disarray. Jewell still hasn't received her tax refund, one of her credit cards was cancelled, and even her driver's license, which she was meant to renew, now lists her as deceased, she told\u00a0Fox 17 West Michigan. And now Jewell's benefits and even her job as a licensed pharmacy technician could be in jeopardy if the problem isn't fixed. 'Everyone has to be licensed in the state of Michigan by the end of June,' she said. 'And so if I don't get this taken care of soon, I will essentially be out of a job.' Jewell's local Social Security office told her that in November 2014 someone had filed her Social Security number as deceased. She said they implied she would be fine and that 'everything's taken care of' But fast-forward three months later and Jewell's Social Security number hasn't been reinstated. She also cannot renew her driver's license, has not received her tax refund and had one of her credit cards cancelled . Dough Nguyen, a deputy regional communications director for Social Security, told Fox 17 that Jewell's situation is very rare. He said about 9,000 living Americans are misreported as deceased to the administration, making up 0.35 per cent of three million annual deaths. But Jewell is part of that small percentage, and she said it has affected every area in her life. 'Your Social Security number is tied to every piece of information about you,' she said. 'So, yeah, it's kind of daunting.'",

The ex-Tottenham and England star, 53, was rushed to hospital after waking up at 1am to find that the leg had gone cold back in 2013. Mabbutt's diabetes had led to a clogged artery in the limb and doctors warned him it was 'touch and go' on whether the leg would have to be amputated. Scroll down for video . Horrific scar: Gary Mabbutt has been left with a\u00a030inch scar on his left leg after his diabetes caused an artery to be clogged requiring emergency surgery to save the limb . He was treated at King's College Hospital in South East London, undergoing an emergency five-hour operation. Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound. Mabbutt, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 17, will not be able to play football again, leaving his dream of becoming a manager in tatters. As he is unable to train with players on the pitch, he has been forced to turn down roles in coaching. Emergency procedure: Surgeons were required to replace the main artery in his left leg with a vein and needed 112 staples to seal the horrific wound . The Spurs legend has spoken for the first time about the agony he went through and says he hopes to raise awareness of his condition. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'When they talked about battling to save my leg, I realised I was helpless. As a diabetic you know complications can occur. But you think \"It's never going to happen to me\". It is vital to educate everyone with diabetes how to take care of themselves. If you have anything unusual with your feet, tingly toes, blisters, see your doctor.' In 1982, father-of-two Mabbutt became the first diabetic ever to play for England and captained Tottenham to FA cup glory in 1991. Former star: Mabbutt is pictured, left, lifting the FA Cup while playing for Tottenham in \u00a01991 . He was unaware that his diabetes had triggered peripheral arterial disease, clogging up the blood vessels in the legs. Every year, surgeons perform around 8,000 amputations on diabetics in the UK - but campaigners say four out five could be prevented. Amputations cost the NHS \u00a3650million a year - and up 80 per cent of the amputees die within five years. Diabates sufferers are entitled to annual eye tests as they are are 20 times more likely to develop sight problems, but Gary Mabbutt wants a similar programme to apply to feet. Experts say millions of diabetics are unaware their condition could lead to foot problems and agree regular checks could save limbs.",

But for those lucky few who travel the world by private jet, the landing fees charged at airports can differ dramatically, with some surprising hubs asking for the highest fees. The high landings fees give an insight into some of the most unexpectedly popular transport hubs for the rich and famous, from Salzburg, in Austria, to Darwin, in Australia. Owning a private jet is a luxury only afford to the wealthy, and you'll need to be to continually fork out for landing charges which can reach thousands every time . Travelling by private jet is a growing trend, with 2.5 million private flights recorded in the US in 2013 (the latest statistics) and 705,000 in Europe. It a huge industry for the rich and famous, with its market worth $16.7trillion in the US and $15.8trillion in Europe. The busiest weekends unsurprisingly occur during huge sporting events, with the Super Bowl in America and the Monaco Grand Prix the priciest times of year to fly and the busiest weekends for private jets companies. Private jet companies such as PrivateFly were estimating costs from New York to Glendale for the Super Bowl this year at around $38,000 (\u00a325,322) on a medium jet and $54,000 (\u00a335,983) on a long-range jet for a round-trip. Salzburg Airport handled 1.6 million passengers in 2012. It charges \u00a32,530 to land a 767-400 jet on its runways . For the Monaco Grand Prix in May, the trip is a more affordable \u00a38,835 ($13,253) from London to Cannes and \u00a38,895 (\u00a313,343) from London to Nice. 1. Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan: \u00a34,559 ($6,850) 2. Narita International Airport in Tokyo, Japan: \u00a33,728 ($5,600) 3. Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan: \u00a33,594 ($5,400) 4. Toronto Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada: \u00a33,461 ($5,200) 5. Darwin International Airport in Darwin, Australia: \u00a33,059 ($4,600) 6. Bristol Airport in Bristol, England: \u00a32,929 ($4,400) 7. Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya, Japan: \u00a32,863( $4,300) 8. Dublin Airport in Dublin, Ireland: \u00a32,729 ($4,100) 9. La Guardia Airport in New York, United States: \u00a32,630 ($3,950) 10. Salzburg Airport in Salzburg, Austria: \u00a32,530 ($3,800) According to private jet charter company PrivateFly, one of the most popular routes in the world is the short hop from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, which costs around \u00a32,890 ($4,340). While Milan dot Rome is the most popular in Europe, a 50-minute flight costing around $5,880 one way. But if you want to fly into any of these 10 airports, you'll be paying much more than that in landing fees. Website\u00a0The Richest\u00a0has compiled a list of the most expensive airports for landing fees, which are based on the 767-400 aircraft, which can hold up to 50 passengers but is often customised for private use. Surprisingly, the three most expensive airports for landing fees are in Japan. By far the most expensive airport is\u00a0Haneda Airport, also known as Tokyo International Airport, where planes are charged a whopping\u00a0\u00a34,559 ($6,850) just for the privilege of landing. Welcoming almost 69million passengers a year, and still maintaining an incredibly high punctuality rating, it is perhaps understandable that fees can be high. Tokyo's Narita International Airprot comes second, charging \u00a33,728 ($5,600), while Kansai International Airport in Osaka charges \u00a33,594 ($5,400) per landing. Number eight on the list of the most expensive airport landing fees is\u00a0Dublin Airport at \u00a32,729 . Somewhat surprisingly, the UK's Bristol Airport makes it into the top 10 as the only British airport featured, charging \u00a32,929 ($4,400) per private jet landing, just behind Toronto in Canada and Darwin, Australia. The only US airport to make it into the top 10 is LaGuardia, in New York, which charges $3,950 (\u00a32,630) for private jets arriving in the city.

    "source": "(CNN)Would a taste of the finest Swiss chocolate make you happy? Or soaking in the warm Icelandic springs? Perhaps the great jazz and rock music scene in Denmark is for you? It's not just the fun activities that make locals and travelers to those countries happy, according to the third World Happiness Report, released by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations on April 23. People who live in the happiest countries have longer life expectancies and more social support, experience more generosity, have more freedom to make life choices, have lower perceptions of corruption and have a higher gross domestic product per capita, the report shows. The tiny country of Bhutan, a very happy country famous for measuring the \"Gross National Happiness\" of its people, gets the credit for focusing world attention on happiness: Its Prime Minister proposed the idea of a World Happiness Day to the United Nations in 2011. Recognizing \"happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world,\" the U.N. General Assembly declared March 20 as World Happiness Day in 2012. This officially designated happy date marked its fourth year last month. Through the happiness report, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network hopes to encourage governments at every level to measure and improve their people's happiness. \"There is no single key to happiness,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, the network's director and an economics professor at Columbia University. \"All of these countries do well in several ways. Being rich? That's good, but it's only a modest part of the story. Trusting society, having a government that ranks on low in corruption, a society where people are generous and volunteering -- all of these are important for happiness.\" Even if you don't live in one of the 10 happiest countries in the world, a visit to these happy places will give you a taste of what the locals enjoy every day. Here are the top 10 happiest places on Earth, according to the World Happiness Report. 1. Switzerland . Switzerland took the top spot from Denmark in 2015, rising from third to first place in this year's list of the world's happiest countries. Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, has the cobblestone streets and medieval architecture that make it apparent why the old city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the city's founding in the 12th century, it has expanded in an often neat and orderly fashion. And the lovely River Aare offers in-town swimming and boating. Looking to get out of the capital city? Book a trip to Lucerne, where you can take a boat trip on the lake, ride the panorama gondola, take in the views on the new Dragon Ride aerial cableway and ride on the world's steepest cog railway. Book the Golden Round trip and get all four trips -- and stunning views of the Alps -- in one day. (The railway reopens in mid-May.) And no matter where you go, there will certainly be plenty of delicious chocolate to try. 2. Iceland . Nature and culture combine to make Iceland a truly happy place, so delightful that the tiny country jumped from ninth to second place this year. Explore South Iceland, where many of the ancient tales -- called sagas -- that document Iceland's 10th- and 11th-century history are remembered.  A two-hour drive from the capital city of Reykjavik, south Iceland is home to Vatnajokull Glacier, the 60-meter (197-foot) Skogafoss Waterfall and amazing fresh seafood. (Though you could probably skip the fermented shark ...) No matter where you visit, there's probably a geothermal swimming pool or hot spring spa to soak your weary bones after a long day of exploring. And when you get back to the capital, note that the renowned annual Reykjavik Art Festival will take place from May 17 through June 7. 3. Denmark . Never mind that Denmark lost the top spot this year and is now the third-happiest country in the world. Looking at all that Danes have to be happy about, you won't notice the slight dip while you're enjoying jazz at the Copenhagen Jazz Festival in July, hanging out with the hipsters at Queen Louise's Bridge, taking a canal tour or playing beach volleyball in front of the Royal Danish Playhouse. Prefer your music in the woods? Head to Smuk Fest (\"The Beautiful Festival\"), a rock/pop festival in the woods of Skanderborg held in August. Wherever you go, enjoy that Danish tradition of \"hygge,\" sometimes translated too simply as the need for \"coziness.\" It's really a complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family, and it makes for one happy country. Project Happy: 10 ways to get happy . 4. Norway . The sun never sets in some parts of Norway during the summer months, and the North Cape area is one of the best spots to play when the sun stays out for 24 hours. Visitors love to golf, hike and even run a marathon during the months ruled by the midnight sun. If your taste buds dictate your travels, head to the Norwegian capital city of Oslo, a gastronomic paradise where the Michelin food guide has awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna (one star each) and Maeemo (two stars). 5. Canada . Canada combines European style, sensibility and history with the enormous natural wonder of North America. Within the French-speaking province of Quebec, a tour through the historic city of Old Quebec is a treat for any Francophile. Founded in the early 17th century, it's the only North American city north of Mexico that still has its fortifications. The historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Just a few minutes from downtown Quebec City, Ile d'Orleans is a small island where farming and agriculture are still a way of life. And if nature is what you crave, in less an hour from Qu\u00e9bec City, you could be hiking through the Parc national de la Jacques-Cartier, home to the glacial Vall\u00e9e de la Jacques-Cartier. 50 states, 50 spots to get happy around the U.S. 6. Finland . What a happy event to spot the rare Saimaa ringed seal, which adapted to freshwater living after the Ice Age cut off its lake home from the sea. There are only about 300 of them in the world, and they can be found at Lake Saimaa in eastern Finland. But you might have more luck spotting the white whooper swan, Finland's national bird, whose arrival heralds the start of spring. For a more urban experience, visit Helsinki's Market Square and Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. And you can still spot animals in the capital city: In mid-May, the cows will be herded into the fields in Viikki, a neighborhood in Helsinki, after the long winter. Locals always gather to celebrate this moo-ving event. 7. Netherlands (Holland) Though the Netherlands' tulips are without equal, and they are most stunning at Keukenhof (known as the Garden of Europe), there are so many beautiful spots across the country to walk and bike to welcome spring and its trademark flower. For a more regal celebration, note that the kingdom celebrates its 200th year this year with many festivities. 8. Sweden . In a country that's very fond of celebration, Swedes love to celebrate midsummer, the longest day of the year, most of all. It's a national holiday marked with traditional food and dances around a maypole. Can't make the midsummer parties? There's still plenty to do. Just 20 minutes from the capital city of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago of about 30,000 islands offers endless opportunities for contentment. Swimming, hiking, cycling, fishing, horseback riding -- it's all within your reach by booking a boat ride. (Some boat trips include meals and tours of many of the islands.) 9. New Zealand . New to the top 10 list of happiest countries, New Zealand has plenty of reasons to celebrate. Though it's always been an attractive spot to explore, Peter Jackson choosing the country to host the filming of the \"Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy has given New Zealand more attention than money could buy. The capital city of Wellington has benefited from the growth of the movie industry, developing a happening restaurant and design scene. And many of the country's natural wonders have gained international attention, including the 2,291-meter (7,516-foot)-high Mount Ngauruhoe, which played the fictional Mount Doom. It's part of Tongariro National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 10. Australia . The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest collection of coral reefs, is a natural phenomenon not to be missed. Australians are arguing fiercely over manmade threats to its existence  (and no one is happy about that). Once you've had a chance to explore that magical underwater realm, head to the Australian state of Tasmania, an island 240 kilometers (149 miles) off the mainland coast. The Tasmanian Wilderness, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, includes one of the last surviving temperate rainforests in the world. To see the wilderness up close, try hiking the stunning 65-kilometer (40-mile) Overland Track. It takes about six days for hikers (who must book the trip in advance), but day-trippers can take short hikes starting at Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and Dove Lake.",

    "source": "The brother of Australia's most notorious serial killer has confessed to knowing of his evil sibling's first victim - and to hiding the truth for 50 years as the 'wrong man' was convicted and behind bars. Boris Milat detailed how his brother, Ivan, shot and paralysed a taxi driver in 1962, more then 25 years before he went on a backpacker killing spree, according to Channel 7's Sunday Night. Neville Knight was shot on March 6, 1962, by a 17-year-old Milat who was riding in the back of his taxi. Scroll down for video . A new report claims Ivan Milat, Australia's most notorious serial killer, could have been caught before he murdered seven backpackers . Mr Milat confessed the shooting was his murderous brother's first violent crime, despite police never once considering him a suspect. 'Ivan shot him - he told me the next day,' Mr Milat told the program. 'His intentions were to rob the driver of his takings. The gun had a hair-trigger... the gun went off. 'The bloke straight away knew he had lost everything in his bottom end. 'You know, his legs ... feelings. He knew it went through his back. He knew he was ... Ivan had paralysed him. 'He (Ivan) got out of the cab and ran.' Alan Dillon was convicted for the shooting and spent five years behind bars. Dillon even confessed to the crime, in an attempt to protect his own brother. Boris Milat told the program a secret about his brother he had kept for more than 52 years . Milat was later sentenced to life in prison, but if the 'wrong man' (right) had not been jailed for his first crime, Milat's victims could have been saved, the program claims . 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' the man imprisoned for Milat's first violent crime, Alan Dillon (right), told the killer's brother, Boris (left) 'They were asking me questions and getting me to sign things,' Dillon told the program when explaining why he confessed to a crime he didn't commit. He said he believed police were going to charge his younger brother for the crime, and confessed to protect him. In the years since, he had always believed the reason for his confession was true, until the program contacted him with its theory. According to claims made by the program, Milat was 17 years old when he shot his first victim, Neville Knight . The daughter of Milat's first victim, Deborah Hutton, was told her father was shot by the serial killer . The report claims Milat's seven victims could have been saved if he had been\u00a0been held accountable for this first chilling crime . Mr Milat said he also lied to protect a brother, but was confessing to bring closure to Dillon. 'Ivan said they were blaming someone else,' he told Sunday Night. 'I didn't think it was good but I didn't want to see him go to jail either, you know, I didn't want to see him harmed. 'But I want to bring closure to the other man, that's why I'm talking. 'Ivan shot this bloke in the back.' Forensic psychiatrist Dr Julian Parmegiani told Sunday Night it was possible Milat set out to paralyse Mr Knight. The horrific intent was shown in his later crimes, where he paralysed many of his victims before they were murdered. Superintendent Clive Small led the investigation into the backpacker murders and now also believes Milat is responsible for the shooting of Knight more than 50 years ago. 'A number of the victims, most of the victims, had multiple stab wounds to the back, around the spinal area, which suggested he was trying to paralyse them while keeping them alive,' Small said. British backpacker Caroline Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head when police found her body . The program also puts Mr Milat face-to-face with the 'wrong man', who was jailed for the first crime his brother committed. 'Don't hold yourself responsible,' Dillon told Mr Milat, as the pair shook hands. Mr Milat told Dillon: 'you've been on me mind a lot'. Mr Knight's daughter, Deborah Hutton, was also unaware her 'courageous' father was Milat's first victim. First victims: Australians James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both aged 19, were Ivan Milat's first known victims after they disappeared in December 1989 and their bodies were found in the Belanglo State forest almost four years later . Simone Schmidl's body was found in November 1993. She had been stabbed to death . Ms Hutton said it was confronting to be told Milat may have shot her father. 'If Dad was the first attempted 'thrill kill'... how horrified can anyone be?' she said. Mr Knight went on to become an advocate for the rights of people with disabilities before he died in 1998. Mr Milat said he hopes his confession can help ease the pain of people impacted by his brother's crimes, and he thought about the first incident 'all the time'. Boyfriend and girlfriend German backpackers Gabor Neugebauer and Anja Habschied were found dead on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart . British backpacker Joanne Walters, is another one of the victims of backpacker murderer Ivan Milat . 'I thought about it... 'how the hell do I fix that'?' he told the program. 'It was a monkey on my back - I had to get rid of it. 'It's not about the victims... it's about the families. The main object of the thing is bringing closure to the other man.' According to the timeline presented by the program and Mr Milat, his murderous brother would have been a 17-year-old when he claimed his first victim. Sinister souvenir: In this photograph police seized from the house of Ivan Milat's brother William, the serial killer is seen carrying the sleeping bag which belonged to Deborah Everist who with boyfriend Jame Gibson was the first of Milat's victims killed in the Belanglo State Forest . Milat, 70, was convicted of butchering seven young people between 1989 and 1992 and burying their bodies in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW. He has been locked up in Goulburn's Supermax jail for almost 20 years. The first two bodies of Milat's victims were discovered on September 19 and 20 1992, when two runners found a decaying corpse in the Belanglo State Forest. Police later confirmed the bodies were of missing British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters. Walters had been stabbed 35 times and Clarke had been shot 10 times in the head. Australia's worst serial killer Ivan Milat kept trophies to remind him of each murder . Milat butchered and buried the bodies of seven young people between 1989 and 1992 in the Belanglo State Forest in southern NSW . The grim finds were just the beginning of a long and extensive search which resulted in the bodies of Australians Deborah Everist and James Gibson being found in October 1993, followed by Simone Schmidl's stabbed body in November of the same year. The decapitated body of German backpacker Anja Habschied was then found along with her boyfriend Gabor Neugebauer on 3 November 1993 in shallow graves 50 metres apart. Milat was convicted of the seven backpacker murders on July 27, 1996 and for the attempted murder, false imprisonment and robbery of Paul Onions. He kept the shirts, sleeping bags, a water bottle, portable stove and backpacks of his victims hidden in roof and wall cavities, in what was described as an 'Aladdin's Cave', in the house he was arrested in 20 years ago.",

    "source": "A former Guantanamo Bay prisoner arrested over the terrorist killing of a top female prosecutor in Uganda had been awarded \u00a31million in compensation by the British government following his release. Jamal Kiyemba, 36, was detained in the Ugandan capital Kampala in connection with the death of Joan Kagezi, who was killed in front of her children days before a major trial against Islamist terror network Al-Shabaab. Kiyemba, a former pharmacy student at a university in Leicester, who grew up in London, was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years and awarded the huge payout after being released. Arrested: Ex-Guantanamo Bay prisoner Jamal Kiyemba, 36 was detained in\u00a0Kampala over the brutal murder of top female prosecutor Joan Kagezi . The 36-year-old is one of 16 former Guantanamo prisoners awarded a \u00a320million payout from the British taxpayer over claims of false imprisonment and human rights abuse. His case was championed by Muslim human rights group CAGE, whose director infamously branded ISIS executioner Mohammed 'Jihadi John' Emwazi an 'extremely gentle, kind, beautiful young man'. He was born in Uganda as Anthony Kiyemba, but converted to Islam aged 20, changing his name to Jamal Abdullah. When the family arrived in Britain following the death of his father in 1993, Kiyemba, then 14, was granted indefinite leave to remain, but never applied for British citizenship. Kiyemba was arrested near Peshawar in Pakistan in March 2002, after allegedly trying to enter Afghanistan in the company of 'a probable al-Qaeda operative, a suspected al-Qaeda operative and a low-level jihadist', U.S. military files reveal. Compensated: Kiyemba was awarded \u00a31million from the British government over claims he had been tortured by U.S. intelligence and interrogated by the MI5 at Guantanamo which had violated his human rights . Kiyemba, however, claims he had gone to Pakistan to study Arabic and the Koran because the country was 'very cheap'. Following his 2006 release, he claimed he had only admitted to terrorist activities under torture by American intelligence officers and that he had been interrogated by MI5. He was held at Guantanamo Bay for four years but as he was not a British citizen, he was not entitled to representation by the Foreign Office nor, on his release, to automatic rights to return to his family. Kiyemba, whose mother, four brothers and sister all live in Britain, was instead deported to Uganda, but made several attempts to be allowed back into the UK. 'I may not be British according to some bit of paper but in reality I am a Brit and always will be,' he said in an interview following his release. 'My doctor, my local mosque, my teens, my education, employment, friends, taxes, home and above all else my family - it is all in Britain.' Support: Kiyemba's compensation claims were championed by human rights charity CAGE, whose research director, Asim Qureshi, pictured, famously branded ISIS executioner Jihadi John a 'kind, beautiful' man . Kiyemba was arrested alongside three others in a suburb to Kampala on Tuesday as a result of an operation aided by U.S. officials, Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said. Jamal Kyiemba is one of 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees paid compensation by the British Government over claims of human rights abuse. A total of \u00a320million has been awarded to former prisoners in an out-of-court settlement after they made allegations against British intelligence, the Sun reports. Others include Shaker Aamer, 48, who still remains in Guantanamo after 13 years without charge or trial, despite being cleared for release twice. Once he is released Mr Aamer, from south London, should be entitled to \u00a31million. Ms Kagezi had been a prosecutor in the ongoing trial of 12 suspects accused of being involved in the July 2010 bombings in which 76 people were killed while watching the World Cup final on TV. Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabaab, who were behind the brutal massacre of nearly 150 students at a Kenyan university this month, claimed responsibility for the attack. Earlier this year, Ms Kagezi had been appointed Head of the International Crimes Division, at the rank of Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions. Kagezi was shot twice by gunmen after she left her car \u2014 in which she was traveling with two of her children on the way home from work \u2014 to buy groceries in a Kampala suburb. After shooting her in the head and neck, the gunmen fled on a motorcycle, according to police. Ugandan police say there is not yet conclusive evidence tying Kiyemba to the murder of Ms Kagezi, but that detectives were questioning him about any possible role and about other offenses. Kiyemba has yet to comment on the allegations. Ugandan police on Tuesday arrested at least six suspects.",

Thomas Cain's mother Ora Mae died in 1943, when he was just 12 years old, and he was left thinking that there were no surviving photographs of her. But this footage, recorded in 2013, shows the moment his enterprising granddaughter, Andrea Ferrell, 29, gave him an old photograph she acquired from a distant relative. Shock and tears: An emotional Thomas Cain is shown, left, looking at the old photograph, while to the right is his shocked expression once he realizes what it is . In the video she hands Mr Cain her present, which dates from the 1920s and shows his mother as a teenager, while his family encourage him. When his daughter, Joyce, explains by saying 'That's your momma', a shocked Mr Cain can only exclaim 'what?!' As the realization dawns on him Mr Cain chokes up and starts crying. He asks 'Where'd it come from?', prompting Ferrell to explain she found it with a distant relative in Florida after appealing for information in her local paper. Long-lost: Mr Cain poses above with the old photograph. He had assumed there was no photographic record of his mother, who died when he was just 13. His mother, Ora Mae, (detail right) is thought to be a teenager in the image, which dates from the 1920s . Gift: Andrea Ferrell, left, hunted down the old image for her beloved grandfather . Writing about the discovery on social media, Ferrell described her 'Pawpaw' as 'the greatest, most humble, God-fearing, family-oriented, loving man in the entire world' adding that 'he deserves' the happy surprise, which took two years to track down. Ferrell also explained that her quest for more photographs of her ancestors is not yet over. In a post she said she is also hunting down pictures of Mr Cain's father, Henry, who also died when he was young. Ferrell told DailyMail.com she has managed to track down images of many of Mr Cain's other relatives, including siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles - but that Henry Cain remains elusive.",

The Orange County district attorney's office said Thursday that 35-year-old Angelika Graswald, of Poughkeepsie, is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 46-year-old Vincent Viafore.

She was later picked up by a boater. Police have yet to find Viafore's body. According to a criminal complaint unveiled Thursday afternoon, prosecutors allege that Graswald intentionally caused Viafore's death. The complaint states that rough waters combined with strong winds caused Viafore\u2019s kayak to overturn. The man was not wearing a life jacket at the time and was unable to turn the capsized boat right-side up. Authorities did not specify what led them to conclude that Graswald was responsible for her fiance's death, only saying that she had made statements implicating herself in the crime. She was arraigned Thursday and ordered held without bail at the Orange County Jail with no bail. She is due back in court May 5. In the days leading up to her arrest, Graswald had been active on her Facebook page, sharing cellphone videos of her cat and uploading a dozen romantic photos of her and Viafore from their time together. As recently as Tuesday, she shared a picture of the happy couple at a lakeside cabin, accompanied by the caption: 'I miss you, my love...'

'Clever ruse': She managed to make it out of the water and call 911. Last Monday, she asked friends on Facebook to keep praying for her partner and hoped for a miracle . The couple, who had been together for many years, were kayaking on the Hudson River between Plum Point and Bannerman\u2019s Island at around 7.30pm April 19 when Viafore's vessel overturned, sending him into the frigid water. Initially, police believed that Graswald tried to help her fiance and fell into the water. She was eventually scooped up by a passing boat and called 911 after reaching land to report Viafore missing. The 35-year-old was taken to hospital and treated for hypothermia but her fiance has not been found.

He added that the couple had been together for a long time and have a 'wonderful relationship'. He said the water at this time of the year is 'precarious' as the water is still cold. Last Monday, she asked friends for their prayers as the search continued. She wrote on Facebook: 'I just want to thank everyone for reaching out. Please, keep your prayers for Vince. 'Miracles ARE possible. The authorities are doing everything they can. 'We do not need anyone else getting hurt, as it is very dangerous out there, especially without daylight. Please, no questions at this point, we're doing everything we can. We will find him.'",

    "source": "The girlfriend of an Arizona State University football player who has been suspended after she accused him of abuse has now publicly recanted her story, claiming that mood swings made her lie about being assaulted. Davon Durant, a promising linebacker at ASU, was arrested on domestic violence charges after his girlfriend of 18 months, Kelsi Langley, claimed that he hit her in the face and grabbed her neck during an argument in his car March 7. Following his arrest, Durant, a transfer from a Kansas college and a five-star recruit, was suspended from the football team indefinitely and could be facing expulsion. She said, she said: Arizona State University football player Davon Durant (left) was arrested last month on domestic abuse charges, but his girlfriend Kelsi Langley is now saying that he never struck her . Speaking out: Langley, an ASU student, held a press conference on campus Tuesday declaring that her boyfriend is innocent, and that she lied about the assault because she was jealous . Less than two weeks after the incident, Langley walked back her previous statements in interviews with reporters, and on Tuesday afternoon she held a press conference that she claims set the record straight. Standing on ASU's campus alongside civil rights leader Reverend Jarret Maupin, the 19-year-old Ms Langley said her earlier assault story was \u2019completely made up' and Durant was innocent. \u2018I was angry. I'm a woman. Women have mood swings,\u2019 Langley said. \u2018We had gotten into an argument about girls trying to talk to him and I was really jealous of that,\u2019 reported AZ Central. Davon Durant pleaded not guilty to one felony count of aggravated assault and three misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct. According to a police report, Kelsi Langely suffered a bruise below her left eye and there were visible finger marks around her neck. The 19-year-old refused medical care and declined to help with her boyfriend\u2019s prosecution, according to Temple police. During Tuesday's press conference, Langley and Maupin pointed a finger of blame at the local police and the media, accusing them of trying to make Durant out to be 'some big black athlete' and blowing a lovers\u2019 quarrel out of proportions. The 19-year-old woman said that during her interview with police after the March 7 incident, officers asked her questions that were 'almost suggestive.' Who's lying?\u00a0According to a police report, Kelsi Langely suffered a bruise below her left eye and there were visible finger marks around her neck - but the student said the neck bruises were love bites and her eyes were red from crying . Rising star: Following his arrest, Durant, a transfer from a Kansas college and a five-star recruit, was suspended from the football team indefinitely and could be facing expulsion . Blame game: Langley and civil rights activist Jarret Maupin accused Temple, Arizona, police and the media of falsely portraying Durant as a thug and his girlfriend as a helpless victim . Maupin said Langley returned to the precinct the next day and withdrew her complaint. She also posted Durant's bail. 'These aren't the actions of someone who has been severely abused or lives in fear,\u2019 the civil rights activist told reporters. Ms Langley insisted that she does not want to be portrayed as a victim 'because that's not the case at all.' \u2018He never laid a finger on me,\u2019 she stated. \u2018Davon would never touch me. There's no way. He's the kindest person I've ever met in my entire life. He couldn't hurt a fly, and it was my anger that got the best of me. she's got his back: Langley posted Durant's bail after his arrest and recanted her story the following day . \u2018Everyone's been in a relationship, everyone gets into arguments, and a lot of people say things that they don't mean.\u2019 However, a 911 recording released by police to Fox 10 Phoenix appears to corroborate Langley's original statement. A witness called police March 7 telling a 911 operator that he had seen a man beating a girl in a car. The caller said other people also witnessed the altercation. But Langley insisted that the witness was wrong, and that their dispute never turned physical. She now wants all charges against Durant dropped. In her first conversation with detectives, Kelsi Langley reportedly described how she got into an argument with Durant and told him she wanted him to leave, reported AZFamily.com. The football player then allegedly demanded that Langley go up to her apartment with him so he could retrieve some of his belongings, but the woman refused. That is when Durant allegedly struck her in the face and squeezed her neck. In his version of events, Durant said he had a verbal dispute with Langley in his car. \u2018When I lied to the police, it was out of spite,\u2019 Langley told ESPN a week and a half after the incident. \u2018I wasn't thinking. It was a very vengeful and spiteful thing to do.\u2019 During the interview, the ASU student said that the bruises on her neck were \u2018hickeys\u2019 and her eyes were red from crying. \u2018I already knew I had marks on my neck, and I knew I could pass them off as something,\u2019 she said. Maricopa County Attorney's Office has released a statement saying: \u2018In domestic violence cases it is especially important to avoid placing victims at the center of evidentiary disputes outside of the court process.",

    "source": "Not a day goes by that 14-year-old Jonathan Pitre doesn't scream in pain. Born with Epidermolysis Bullosa - or 'butterfly skin' - his body is covered with deep blistering wounds that will never heal. Holding cutlery to eat is incredibly difficult. Bathing is excruciating. Scroll down for video . Struggle: Born with Epidermolysis Bullosa, Jonathan is covered with deep blistering wounds that won't heal . Pain: He must be bathed and bandaged every day. His skin is as fragile as a butterfly's wing . Team work: Jonathan, 14, said he could not get through life without his mother Tina who carries and feeds him . 'You never know exactly what EB is unless you have it... just the feel of it, the pain that you live in every day,' the bandaged teenager remarks in an interview with the\u00a0Ottawa Citizen. 'Even when I'm sleeping, when I'm dreaming, I still am sort of conscious because I feel that pain.' Unless a cure is found, Jonathan will likely only live to 25. But in a tone well beyond his years, Ottawa-based Jonathan says frankly: 'I just have to get on with it.' One in every 17,000 people suffer from the genetic condition. Healthy skin is made up of three layers, but Jonathan is missing the middle layer which holds the inner and outer layers together. Dreams: He had to stop playing sports so has turned his focus to sportscasting - and the experts are impressed with his maturity and knowledge. He is pictured here with a Vikings Junior ice hockey player . Difficulties: Both Tina and Jonathan say they try not to think about the fact that he has a life expectancy of 25 . Inspiring: He says he can even feel pain when he is asleep but is trying his best to 'live in the moment' Sufferers are dubbed the 'butterfly children' due to the fragility of their skin: as breakable as a butterfly wing. The condition has outlined Jonathan from many childhood activities. A sports fanatic, he played hockey and loved gym class until his condition meant he could not compete with the other children. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a general term used to describe a group of rare inherited skin disorders that cause the skin to become very fragile. Any trauma or friction to the skin can cause painful blisters. Mason has the rarest form of EB where blistering occurs at the junction between the epidermis and the dermis. In most cases, the symptoms of EB are obvious from birth. It is caused by faulty genes inherited from one or both parents. There are many cases when both parents are carriers of the faulty gene without realising it. EB is rare. Just one in every 17,000 children has it. There are thought to be 5,000 people living with EB in the UK. There is no cure for EB so the treatment aims at preventing blisters becoming infected. Moving forward, he is channeling his fascination into other aspects of sports. He has appeared as a sportscaster on Canadian TV shows, and guest commentated football games for SportsNet. 'It's unfortunate but you've just got to go with the flow, there's nothing I can do about it,' he told the Ottawa Citizen. 'I just studied different options - if I can't do this I'll think of other options. So that's why I came into sportscasting and scouting and coaching, that's where it all started. 'I can't play sports but there's much more to sports than players.' Professionals are astounded, remarking on his knowledge, his confidence and his maturity. Jonathan credits these attributes to his condition: 'Because I can't play sports, I stay with the adults. So I guess I had to kind of grow up faster.' He admits there is a 'nagging' feeling at the back of his mind every day that 'I only have 10 years left.' But for now, he's trying to 'live in the moment.' 'Great things do not come easily,' he told an audience at National We Day last week. 'But they do come when you try with your full heart, when you're willing and open to embrace life, when you take things one day at a time and use what you've got.' His mother, Tina, said it is a struggle every day as she bathes him, knowing he is in pain. However, she cherishes the silver lining: 'I see him every day waking up with a smile.'",

    "source": "(CNN)Soon, America will be too fat to fight. Forget about rampant diabetes, heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country. In about five years, so many young Americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers. That alarming forecast comes from Maj, Gen. Allen Batschelet, who is in charge of U.S. Army Recruiting Command. Obesity, he told me, \"is becoming a national security issue.\" I was so taken aback by Batschelet's statement that I felt the need to press him. Come on! Obesity? A national security crisis? The General didn't blink. \"In my view, yes.\" Of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country, only 72,000 qualified. Some didn't make the cut because they had a criminal background, or a lack of education, or too many tattoos. But a full 10% didn't qualify because they were overweight. Before you accuse me of sensationalizing, it's that 10% figure that worries General Batschelet the most. \"The obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction,\" he said. \"We think by 2020 it could be as high as 50%, which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the Army.\" He paused. \"It's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now.\" The problem is so worrisome for the Army that recruiters have become fitness coaches, like the trainers on the NBC show, \"The Biggest Loser.\" Yes, your tax dollars pay for Army recruiters to play Dolvett Quince or Jillian Michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits. If they lose enough weight, they're sent to boot camp. Some make it; many don't. But, General Batschelet told me the Army must try. \"We are the premier leader on personal development in the world,\" he told me. \"We want to see you grow and become a leader. That is a great strength in our Army.\" Except the Army never considered the type of growth it's now contending with. Nowadays \"personal development\" means working on both character and ... girth. The general, along with so many others in this country, is struggling with why so many Americans, despite all the warnings, continue to eat too much and exercise too little. I have a theory. It ain't pretty. But it's got to be true: We just don't care. \"The acceptance of obesity is prevalent,\" according to Claire Putnam, an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now. \"When you look around you, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. It's seems normal,\" she said. Just look at the numbers: More than one-third of U.S. adults are obese. Seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese. That's triple the rate from just a generation ago. So, maybe we should face the fact that we've grown comfortable with our girth. It is crystal clear we haven't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who doesn't. Just the other day, Twitter trolls scolded the singer, Pink, for gaining weight. Pink is not remotely fat. Neither is Selena Gomez, haters. Or Britney Spears, hecklers. If 70% of us are overweight in this country, why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese? Maybe it's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves. Because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial. Dr. Putnam points to one of Kaiser Permanante's medical questionnaires. You know, the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor. There is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to \"opt out of talking about obesity.\" Some patients refuse to step on the scale. \"You want to be sensitive to that patient,\" Putnam told me. \"You don't want to nag. But, doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this.\" CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, agrees with Putnam. \"Perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem,\" he said to me. \"If a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told. You know, this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions. We should call them what they really are: a brain injury, not 'getting your bell rung.' In the same vein, we should tell people who are overweight or obese that, clinically, they're 'overweight' or 'obese' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book.\" In other words, chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese. Just like \"fat\" is not the proper term for Pink or Selena Gomez. And, yes, semantics matter. According to the CDC, 81% of overweight boys and 71% of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight. We've clearly lost our perspective on what's normal when it comes to a healthy weight. So much so it's becoming a national security problem. So what will it take? The answer cannot be the U.S Army.",

    "source": "Like hundreds of thousands of others, model and TV personality Jesinta Campbell was a fan of wellness blogger Belle Gibson and followed her inspirational story of cancer survival. But after Gibson finally admitted she faked her multiple cancer diagnoses \u2013 following months of speculation and the undoing of her health empire \u2013 Campbell has joined the chorus of angry followers who say they feel insulted by her deception. 'I am so disappointed and shocked and on every level, this is so irresponsible on her behalf,' Campbell said on the Today Show on Thursday morning. 'I was actually at an awards ceremony - the Cosmopolitan Fun Fearless Female Awards - and she was awarded with one of the big awards there. 'And she was on stage and she was giving this speech, and she was crying, and I was crying, and I just feel like she's really let everyone down. 'It's just so irresponsible. I followed her on her blog, on her app, it's really disappointing.' Scroll down for video . Jesinta Campbell (right) says she shed tears with Belle Gibson (left) at the Cosmopolitan Fun Fearless Female Awards last year. They are both pictured at the event . Belle Gibson pictured at the awards with Sunrise host Samantha Armytage in November last year . The controversial wellness blogger has finally admitted she faked her multiple cancer diagnoses . Model\u00a0Jesinta Campbell has joined the chorus of angry followers who say they feel let down by Belle Gibson . In a magazine interview, Belle Gibson has admitted her fatal cancer 'diagnoses' were lies. 'No. None of it is true,' she said, during a series of interviews published in the latest edition of the\u00a0Australian Women's Weekly. Ms Gibson's interview is published in this month's edition of the Australian Women's Weekly . In the interviews - which questioned her relationship with the truth and her understanding of cancer - Gibson said she was not seeking forgiveness. 'I don't want forgiveness. I just think (it) was the responsible thing to do. Above anything, I would like people to say, \"Okay, she's human\". Gibson's confession was the first time she has spoken publicly since - under fire from furious former fans - she told\u00a0Daily Mail Australia\u00a0she feared for her family's safety. On Thursday, Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia they were not investigating Gibson and the matter was being looked after by Consumer Affairs Victoria. In 2013, the wellness blogger became a prominent Australian social media personality after she announced she had cured a malignant brain tumour through diet and natural therapies. Her Instagram fan base ballooned after she 'revealed' she had prolonged her life by embracing an alternative lifestyle. Her Instagram fan base ballooned and her 'whole foods' business became hugely successful. Penguin published her recipe book The Whole Pantry and her app was to be offered on the Apple Watch. But it all fell apart last month after revelations emerged Ms Gibson had failed to\u00a0fulfill\u00a0promised donations\u00a0to various charities. Friends then began to cast doubts about her cancer diagnoses. She then tearfully 'admitted' she may have been 'misdiagnosed' by a 'Dr Phil'. 'I am so disappointed and shocked and on every level, this is so irresponsible on her behalf,' Campbell said on the Today Show on Thursday morning . Ms Gibson revealed the truth of her cancer diagnosis in an interview . The magazine article claims\u00a0Gibson is due to meet with her publisher Penguin Books - which incurred a number of losses when the company was forced to withdraw her book and cancel overseas launches - but a company spokesman said there was no meeting planned. 'We are disappointed that, despite several requests for clarification regarding recent \u00adallegations made against her, Belle is yet to res\u00adpond to us \u00addirectly,' a spokeswoman said. 'We have read with interest her recent interview and are considering our rights and options as set out in our agreement with her.' The  Weekly insists it did not pay for the story and that it was approached by Ms Gibson's 'people', the Melbourne 'corporate advisory' firm Bespoke Approach. Ms Gibson said her partner, Clive Rothwell, was sticking by her in spite of the controversy. But she said he had taken a 'stern' line with her and insisted she play a straight bat. 'He's been very stern, along the lines of, 'I just want you to acknowledge where you've f***ed up and try not to smooth over that,' she was quoted saying. In the article, titled 'My Lifelong Struggle With The Truth', Ms Gibson also said she had been forced to raise herself from the day she started school. Ms Gibson, pictured kissing her son on the head, said: 'None of it was true' Her business empire in tatters and her relationship with her fans broken, Ms Gibson is thought to be struggling financially. The Women's Weekly said she was not paid for her interview . She said she took upon common household responsibilities, such as bringing her brother to school and making lunches.\u00a0But she would not provide her mother's name or contact details to the magazine. In her previous interview, Ms Gibson said she understood 'everyone's anger and confusion'. But she took aim at many of her former fans who she believed had responded 'maliciously' - claiming that her son's childcare details, home address and floor plan were published online. Former friends had called upon Ms Gibson to 'come clean' with the truth about her situation and had long privately questioned the veracity of her story. A former friend of Ms Gibson directly called on her to 'come clean' in an interview with Daily Mail Australia in March. Mother-of-two Jayme Smith, 28, from Sydney, became a confidant of Ms Gibson's after they met on a parenting discussion page on Facebook around 2010. The Whole Pantry (pictured above, in cookbook form) was also a popular app. It will not appear on the Apple Watch any longer . They forged an online friendship and confided over their experiences with cancer - Ms Smith having lost her mother to lung cancer in 2003 and Ms Gibson saying she had brain cancer. Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia last month she was 'baffled' when reports emerged this week where friends raised doubts about Ms Gibson's medical diagnoses and charity donations. 'I am just so shocked and I feel betrayed, that we all fell so hard for the illusion that she created,' Ms Smith said. 'It has hit all of us, who I know, (who) also know Belle, like a tonne of bricks.' 'We only knew her online, but we all believed to a point that she was a genuine pioneer, who was surviving aggressive cancer. 'Belle and I talked quite a bit about my feelings about (cancer), how she could empathise with me, the feelings I felt about my mother dying and how I'd wished I was more responsible when it happened, that I'd wished I had tried to explore more ideas, like Belle did.' Ms Smith said Ms Gibson 'pushed' - and nearly convinced her - not to vaccinate her children, but that she did not blame her for nearly making that choice, which she 'backed out of at the last minute'. Jayme Smith (pictured left, with her two children) met Belle Gibson online and maintained a friendship over social media until they had a falling out . 'That was my own choice, based on information provided by Belle. I regret that choice (to nearly not vaccinate), but it was my own. I'm not here to place blame.' In November 2014, Ms Gibson told Sunday Style\u00a0magazine she blamed the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil for her cancer. She told her social media followers last year her brain cancer had spread to her blood, liver, spleen, uterus and that she did not expect to survive. After friends and medical experts cast doubt on her medical claims, Ms Gibson told The Australian she may have been 'misdiagnosed'. 'It's hard to admit that maybe you were wrong,' she told the newspaper, adding that she was 'confused, bordering on humiliated'. Ms Smith said of Belle Gibson (above): 'If I saw Belle now, I would just ask her to tell the truth. That's all I want'",

The fans who made it to the United's training ground were clearly overjoyed to have the opportunity to meet Rooney, captain for the club and England. They also took the chance to engage with Van Gaal, who was obviously much more welcoming than he was towards the media after United's 1-0 loss to Chelsea on Saturday. The Dutchman felt aggrieved at what he perceived to be a foul on Falcao by John Terry in the build-up the Eden Hazard's decisive strike at Stamford Bridge. 'For me, it was a foul. That's my opinion on Falcao,' Van Gaal fumed after the game. 'You are dependable on the referee. When he whistles, its a penalty. When he doesn't whistle for a foul on Falcao, it's not a foul.' Michael Carrick (left) and Ashley Young also visited the sick children and adults on Monday . Van Gaal (left) and his players also signed memorabilia for the visitors from the Foundation . Van Gaal was upset on Saturday that John Terry appeared to foul Falcao before Eden Hazard scored .

    "source": "(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. \"We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,\" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally \"possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have.\" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd? CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.",

Dale and Debra Krein of Rogue River filed a suit in 2012 against their neighbors and their giant Tibetan mastiffs. Winners! Debra and Dale Krein (pictured) have been awarded $240,000 after complaining that their neighbors' Tibetan mastiffs have caused them more than a decade of disquiet by barking until 5am . Overruled: John Updegraff and Karen Szewc (above)  tried to argue they needed the dogs for their livestock . Finally, after three years of proceedings, a jury has ruled in favor of the disgruntled Oregonians, ordering for the canines to be debarked within 60 days. Debarking is a surgical operation that reduces tissue in the vocal chords. The procedure lowers the volume of a dog's bark. The Kreins claimed their lives have been plagued by the noise since the defendants, John Updegraff and Karen Szewc, started breeding dogs in 2002. According to the Mail Tribune, the canines would routinely bark until 5am and throughout the day outside the property just 300 feet from the Kreins. The jury ruled that the Tibetan mastiffs (stock image), born in 2002, should have their vocal chords removed . Irritation: The Kreins' property (right) is less than 300 meters from Updegraff and Szewc (center), who claim to keep livestock on their sprawling land. The jury ruled their dogs were unsuited to protecting livestock . This continued, they told the court, despite the fact that Updegraff and Szewc were cited by Jackson County Animal Control in 2002 and 2004 for violating public nuisance codes. The defendants attempted to argue that the mastiffs were needed to protect their livestock. However, on Thursday a judge at Jackson County Circuit Court ruled the animals were not suited to the role.

    "source": "Five time Emmy-winning actress Candice Bergen, now 68, confesses she was the highest paid actor in television for a lot of years after playing the title role in the hit CBS sitcom, Murphy Brown that ran for ten years starting in 1988. \u2018The job security was incredible. And I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun\u2019. \u2018I have made a lot of money. Most of this is the incomparable TV Money. Nothing like it\u2019. After the first year of the hit TV show, when she won the Golden Globe and Emmy for best actress, her salary headed skyward for over ten years and she kept that fact a secret. Financial secrets prevailed in her upbringing by her model/ actress mother and her famous father, Edgar Bergen, best known for as ventriloquist who's sidekick was dummy Charlie McCarthy. Scroll down for video . Puppet envy: In her new memoir, Candice Bergen writes that her father belittled her looks and favored his dummy. She reveals that she would sit on one of her father\u2019s knees at the breakfast table and Charlie McCarthy sat on the other.\u2018A gentle squeeze on the back of my neck was my cue to open and shut my mouth so he could ventriloquize me. Charlie and I would chatter together silently, while behind us Dad would supply the snappy repartee for both of us' Success: Candice starred in the long-running TV hit Murphy Brown, here with costar Grant Shaud . Happy at last: Candice Bergen and husband Marshall Rose t the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party . Edgar spent more time with the dummy than his first-born child, Candice. And when he died in 1978, her penurious father left his only daughter out of his will - but not Charlie.. Charlie McCarthy was willed $10,000 with the proviso that the funds be managed, invested and reinvested to fund ventriloquist performances in the future. Edgar wrote \u2018I make this provision for sentimental reasons which to me are vital due to the association with Charlie McCarthy who has been my constant companion and who has taken on the character of a real person and from whom I have never been separated even for a day\u2019. \u2018I\u2019d chased my father\u2019s approval all my life and here was proof I\u2019d never get it\u2019, the actress candidly reveals in her new memoir, A Fine Romance, published by Simon & Schuster. Charlie McCarthy dominated Candy\u2019s childhood. She sat on one of her father\u2019s knees at the breakfast table and Charlie sat on the other. \u2018A gentle squeeze on the back of my neck was my cue to open and shut my mouth so he could ventriloquize me. Charlie and I would chatter together silently, while behind us Dad would supply the snappy repartee for both of us. Charlie had his own bedroom next to mine \u2013 and his was bigger. Candy's competition for her dad's affections was not with a sibling - it was with her ventriloquist EdBound to give Charlie McCarthy . \u2018Those were unique circumstances to grow up in. Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being,' she writes . \u2018Those were unique circumstances to grow up in. Sometimes I have to give myself credit for being a functional human being\u2019. \u2018I knew my father loved me, but with his Swedish reserve, it wasn\u2019t his nature to tell me\u2019, Bergen writes. He was not physically affectionate and when the young girl decided to get over her own terror of trying to say she loved him, his response to her declaration was a pat on the hand. But the two would go up in his plane together and he\u2019d prop the young girl up on phonebooks and let her fly the plane. They also went on fishing outings together and took long breakfast rides on horseback when visiting Palm Springs. \u2018Still I was hurt, shocked when I discovered he had left me out of his will\u2019. She didn\u2019t need the money but it was an emotional slight. Edgar also kept secrets from his wife \u2013 the contents of a safe in his study. When Candice and her mother finally figured out the combination after his death, the name \u2018Charlie\u2019 transposed into numbers, the door opened to reveal fabulous pieces of jewelry that Edgar had purchased and stowed away as investments and also to avoid paying taxes on them. Mrs. Frances Bergen, known professionally as Frances Westcott after becoming \u2018the Chesterfield Girl\u2019 and the \u2018Ipana (toothpaste) Girl\u2019 in newspaper ads and on billboards, had no clue as to the existence of the large marquis diamond ring or the beautiful diamond necklace with an aquamarine the size of an egg. Edgar never included her in any financial discussion but after his death, she became the \u2018stock witch\u2019, cleverly quadrupling the value of the estate over twenty years. Charlie McCarthy always dominated Candice\u2019s life. She compared playing her award-winning title role on Murphy Brown to channeling her inner Charlie. The Murphy Brown character fit her like a glove and \u2018gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self\u2019. Her father was schizophrenic in the same way -- buttoned-down, quiet, and introverted\u2013 unless he was with friends or had Charlie with him, an invitation to be risqu\u00e9 and tell dirty jokes. Director Louis Malle and actress Candice Bergen attend the 'Dangerous Liaisons' \u00a0premier in 1988 . \u2018He belonged to a men\u2019s group called the Rancheros Visitadores. They would go on weekend horseback rides and camp out and tell stories and fart around a campfire\u2019. Then he would revert to his introverted self when back at home. Candice married the brilliant French film director, screenwriter and producer Louis Malle in 1980. When she became pregnant with their first and only child, Chloe Malle, Candice agonized over whether or not she would be able to tell the baby still in her womb that she loved her. She had never heard those words growing up and had never been able to tell her parents she loved them until late in their lives and well into her thirties. For thirty-nine years, those feelings were suppressed until Chloe was born in 1985 and then the infant hijacked Candice\u2019s feelings and turned her into a lunatic if she was separated from the child. The little girl became the love of her life distancing her from Malle. He escaped Los Angeles to work in France and New York. But the couple remained devoted and thought about having a second child until Louis was diagnosed with myelofibrosis that morphed into lymphoma and inflammation of the brain. The illness was fatal.' \u2018I was in a black anger. I felt that my life, which had always been blessed, had suddenly been hijacked by this completely other force.\u2019 Candice's daughter Chloe is engaged and will marry in France, as her mother did Chloe's father, this summer . \u2018I felt like my heart was breaking\u2019. She hid in the housekeeper\u2019s room and cried at night. She sought out primal scream therapy and was angry that that her life was being taken away from her and that she had become caretaker. Louis died in November 1995 at age sixty-three and Bergen confesses she still thinks about him all the time. \u2018We loved each other completely, then were pulled apart by distance\u2019. Three years later in 1998, she met Marshall Rose, who had been chairman of the New York Public Library, a real estate developer, philanthropist and a billionaire. They married in June 2000 and writes that she found this new married life claustrophobic. She and Louis had lived together and apart with his work in Europe. Now \u2018Marsh\u2019 was reaching out for a closeness she found excessive and suffocating and reacted to with tiny tantrums. Back to analysis that helped her open up to the continued tenderness of her second husband. Feeling too old for movies, feeling like a clich\u00e9, a middle-aged actress with no job offers, she was suffering from empty nest syndrome until the offer to act in Boston Legal in 2005 came along and rescued her from her anxieties. These days Bergen accepts the thirty pounds she\u2019s packed on since her marriage to Marsh. She accepts that she is \u2018a champion eater. \u2018No carb is safe \u2013 no fat either\u2019. Always a compulsive eater, when she was a young girl, she consumed twelve peanut butter and jelly sandwich halves in less than ten minutes. She no longer overeats past gratification but still indulges in cookies and ice cream if she can find where the housekeeper has hidden them and Parmesan cheese. She writes there is so much fat in her face that the skin is stretched to the max while hanging in folds under her chin. She\u2019s on meds for mini-strokes she first suffered while taping Boston Legal, but she\u2019s off the Prozac that had been prescribed. She\u2019s given up chasing plastic surgery or fills to look younger and has settled in a loving and devoted relationship with Marsh.

    "source": "Thirty years after the Bradford City fire which killed 56 football supporters, a new book written by a survivor of the disaster claims it was not an accident. Author Martin Fletcher points the finger at the late Stafford Heginbotham, Bradford City's chairman at the time and a businessman who had been linked to eight previous blazes. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' writes Fletcher, after 15 years spent researching the fire in which four members of his family died. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . The 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at Bradford's ground in 1985 . Fire engulfs Valley Parade on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire . Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . His brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were among the 54 Bradford supporters and two Lincoln supporters who did not survive. Fletcher, who was 12 at the time became determined to challenge the accepted theories which he believes were founded upon a flawed investigation. He discovered that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to at least eight other fires at business premises and insurance claims dating back to 1967. His findings have been published in Fifty-Six \u2013 The Story of the Bradford Fire, which is being serialised in The Guardian. It stops short of a direct accusation of arson but inferences are clear and he is certain more should have been done at the time to investigate the disaster and those responsible. He hopes these questions can be officially addressed and that his research will prompt a new investigation into the disaster as the 30th anniversary approaches next month. No-one has sought accountability for the fire since the official inquiry chaired by High Court judge Oliver Popplewell recorded its findings following five days of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. The inquiry found that a small fire was probably caused by a spark from a discarded cigarette or match dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. It was the final game of the season and should have been a day of celebration. Before kick-off Bradford were presented before with the trophy for winning the Third Division title. The fire was noticed towards the end of the first half and within four minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. There were no fire extinguishers and no designated fire escapes. A 12-year-old Martin Fletcher is comforted by his mother Susan in 1985 after the Bradford Fire disaster . One survivor looks distraught with his burns visible (left) while another sits in front of a burned out stand . Prime minister Margaret Thatcher visits the scene of the disaster with her husband Dennis in 1985 . Tributes paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day Bradford should have been celebrating . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around \u00a330,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. The tragedy, followed by Heysel, less than three weeks later, and Hillsborough in 1989, accelerated safety changes in football ground. The community turned inwards to comfort each other. They raised money for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary and supported friends through the aftermath of loss, physical pain and the psychological problems. They were not inspired by the need to fight and clear their names like the families of those killed at Hillsborough. As a whole they accepted it was a terrible accident and nothing came from the media or the courts to change that view. Bradford City reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service, attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. Times have changed and social media has fuelled a craving for public outpourings of sympathy. Football's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute's silence before all games on April 25, when Bradford play Barnsley at Valley Parade. It is the final game of the season and Bradford always remember the victims of the fire at the home game closest to the anniversary. Representatives from Bradford and Lincoln have also been invited to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend and the FA will be represented at the annual memorial service in Bradford on May 11. These are specific to the 30th anniversary and yet are in tune with a general increase in attention which has coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes. But it sits uneasily with many at Valley Parade. Then-Bradford chairman  Heginbotham (left) outside Valley Parade, where 56 people died and 265 were injured . The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . Investigators look around the burned out stand at Bradford's ground following the tragedy in 1985 . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to Wembley when Bradford reached the League Cup final two years ago. Arsenal and Hull fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year's FA Cup final, a well-intentioned mark of solidarity copied by Oldham fans at Valley Parade, this season. Others have turned up and started to sing 'Stand up for the 56'. Again, this has provoked a mixed response. Some Bradford supporters believe the victims should be remembered in this way, others prefer it to keep it private. A stage documentary called The 56 is touring local theatres and children's entertainers the Chuckle Brothers have launched a charity single with members of Black Lace. Another fan has been selling old seats numbered 1-56 which were reclaimed from the stand this year while '56' branded hoodies and T-shirts are on sale, some more tasteful than others. Profits from some of these ventures will go to the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit (PSBRU) at the University of Bradford, set up by Professor David Sharpe after the fire. In another year of success for Bradford City, with FA Cup wins against Chelsea and Sunderland, the club has found the dynamic is altering around what was once called football's less remembered tragedy. It may never be the same again after Martin Fletcher's book. He started his own investigations in 1994, when his mother told him Valley Parade had not been Heginbotham's first fire. The more he unearthed, the more his mind was made up. His findings will disturb the peace in Bradford.",

    "source": "Garissa, Kenya (CNN)The Kenyan government says Mohamed Mohamud, also known by aliases Dulyadin and Gamadhere, is the mastermind of Thursday's Kenya university terror attack, according to a tweet from the country's Interior Ministry. Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia, took responsibility for the attack, according to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. Mohamud is \"credited with having an extensive terrorist network within Kenya,\" according to a ministry document given to CNN. Earlier, the ministry posted a \"Most Wanted\" notice for Mohamud. It offers a reward of 20 million Kenyan shillings, which is about $215,000. \"We appeal to anyone with any info on #Gamadhere to share with relevant authorities and security agencies,\" the Interior Ministry posted on Twitter. Mohamud is in charge of external operations against Kenya, the document says, and he is the regional commander within Al-Shabaab in charge of the Juba region. In this role, he commands the militia along the border and \"is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country.\" His network extends within the Dadaab refugee camp, the document says. Dadaab is the world's biggest refugee camp, home to thousands of people, according to the United Nations. It's located in Kenya's North Eastern province near Somalia. CNN Exclusive: Exposing smuggler routes across the Somalia-Kenya border . Mohamud has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years, including December's quarry attack, which killed at least 36 people. In that attack, Al-Shabaab militants separated non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and killed them. Mohamud is Kenyan and has three wives and three siblings, including two with links to Al-Shabaab, the document says. Also Sunday, Kenya's Interior Ministry identified another terrorist involved in the Garissa University College attack as Abdirahim Abdullahi. Abdullahi's father, Abdullahi Daqare, a government chief in Mandera in northern Kenya, told CNN that his son was missing. Daqare is a Kenyan Somali, he said. His son graduated in 2013 from Nairobi University law school and worked for a bank for two months before he went missing, Daqare said in a phone interview. \"I have received reports from people who found information (on) the Internet that my son was one of the terrorists,\"  Daqare said. \"I previously told the government that the son is missing. I sought their help to find the whereabouts of my son.\" He added that the two had not been in contact his the son disappeared. Daqare said he had \"really given up on him.\" On Sunday, families of some of the more than 147 people slain at Garissa University College left a mortuary in Nairobi, Kenya, after identifying the bodies of their loved ones. One woman almost had to be carried out. \"Why? Why? Where are you, my children?\" she wailed. Across Garissa, there was a sense of fear, foreboding and grief. The news agency Reuters videotaped a man holding his daughter's hand at a local church, as military patrols and security officials searched people. A church member told the agency, \"Nowhere is safe, but here in church you can come, you be with God and then you just console yourself.\" Horrific stories of survival and tales of massive loss continue to emerge. To survive Al-Shabaab militants blazing through her dorm, shooting and killing classmates, 19-year-old Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds. The gunmen called them out. \"(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,\" Cheroitich told CNN. \"And then, if you know, you go to the other side.\" The teenager didn't see what happened next. She heard it. \"They were shooting everywhere,\" she said. \"I didn't want to open my eyes.\" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. \"I was scared so much,\" she recalled. Garissa is a town about 90 miles from the Somali border. Al-Shabaab is based in Somalia, but it hasn't confined its terrorism to the lawless nation. In 2013 militants attacked Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming, as it promised \"another bloodbath\" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nathif Jama Adam, the governor of Garissa County. \"The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,\" Adam said. \"They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business.\" He said the militants were \"bent on nothing but destruction\" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. \"But that is something we need to fight,\" Adam said. Five arrested in Kenya attack . Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. \"These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,\" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as those who supported them. In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism \"has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people.\" Kenyatta condemned \"corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab.\" \"There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,\" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an \"existential threat to our republic,\" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to \"tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state.\" \"That fight will never change,\" he added. \"Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life.\" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter .

    "source": "A bolt of lightning has been spotted soaring from the top of a cloud before looping back on itself and striking the ground in Australia. The image was captured over Jaibru in Australia by an off-duty emergency services officer who dubbed the phenomenon 'looping lightning'. Upwards lightning is possible, but is very rare - with current estimates suggesting less than one per cent of lightning strikes travelling in an \u2018upwards\u2019 direction. And storm chaser Dan Robinson believes 'looped lightning' is simply a trick of perspective, based on where the viewer is stood, meaning it appears to rise and loop even though it is not. This image was captured over Jaibru in Australia by emergency services officer Scott Murray, who dubbed the phenomenon looping lightning'. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than 1% of lightning travels in an \u2018upwards\u2019 direction. But storm chaser Dan Robinson said 'looped' lighting may instead be a trick of perspective, based on where a viewer is stood, meaning it appears to loop when it's not . The 'looping lightning' image was taken by  Scott Murray and the bolt appears to shot out and up from the cloud before curving towards the Earth. Typically lightning is seen from a distance, or from the side, and it is rare to capture an image almost directly beneath a bolt. As a result, this can skew its perspective. In particular, if the bolt is travelling straight at the viewer - so they are almost looking up the length of the bolt - \u00a0it can make it appear as if it is curving because of its forked nature. There have been examples of lightning appearing to make complete circular loops, but this is also a trick of the eye. Lightning is caused by the build up of electrostatic charge in clouds. As they develop, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds. The preceding flash causes an electrical field change, which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object like a building or wind turbine. During winter snow storms, it is possible for tall objects to initiate upwards lightning without preceding flashes. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an \u2018upwards\u2019 direction. It is typically classified into three groups. The smallest are starters, which extend up to a  altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30km). Next are jets, which extend 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50km), and the last are gigantic jets, which reach 44 to 56 miles (70 to 90km). Positive charge builds up in one area of the cloud, while negative charges build up in the other - typically the top and bottom of the cloud respectively. If this build up of charge reaches a certain level, the insulating capacity of the air breaks causing the negative charges to escape or 'leap' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground. As negative charges gather in the bottom of a cloud, the negative charges in the ground are forced from the surface, leaving it positive. When a so-called 'streamer' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud, it is therefore attracted to the ground, which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up. In particular, the negative 'stepped leaders' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to Earth, with the least resistance. This is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud. As the streams connect it causes electrons to jump, or 'return the stroke', and an electrical current begins flowing, which creates lightning. This flash temporarily equalises the charged regions, until the opposite charges build up again. Lightning can occur between opposite charges within the thunderstorm cloud, known as intra-cloud lightning, or between opposite charges in the cloud and on the ground, referred to as cloud-to-ground lightning. And there are roughly five to 10 times as many cloud flashes as there are cloud-to-ground flashes. Within these strikes are two types of ground flashes known as natural and triggered. The latter includes strikes to very tall structures, planes, rockets and towers and goes from the ground up to the cloud. Natural lightning is cloud to ground. Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds. The preceding flash causes an electrical field change, which allows an upward positive leader to originate from a tall object. Upwards lightning is very rare - estimates suggest less than one per cent of lightning travels in an \u2018upwards\u2019 direction - and it is typically classified into three groups, based on peak altitude. The smallest are starters, which extend up to a maximum altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30km). Next are jets, which extend 25 to 31 miles (40 to 50km), and the last are gigantic jets, which reach 44 to 56 miles (70 to 90km). Lightning is caused by a build up of electrostatic charges. As they develop, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud, and between the cloud and the ground.\u00a0If this build up reaches a certain level, the insulating capacity of the air breaks. The negative charge 'leaps' from the cloud either onto another another cloud - known as sheet lightning - or to the ground (pictured) When a so-called 'streamer' of negative charges leaps from the bottom of the cloud, it is attracted to the ground, which in turn emits a streamer of positive charges from the ground up. In particular, the negative 'stepped leaders' fork downwards looking for the best conductive path to Earth, with the least resistance. This is why these stepped leaders typically travel straight down from the cloud (pictured) However, the upward movement of the lightning in Mr Murray's image doesn't appear to extend as high as other forms of upward lightning, and storm chaser Dan Robinson suggests an alternative. He explained: 'Sometimes a lightning channel will have the illusion of 'looping back' on itself or having bright knots in it. The reason behind this phenomenon is quite simple. 'Lightning is three-dimensional - it 'zigs' and 'zags' in all directions. As the streams connect, it causes electrons to jump, or 'return the stroke', and an electrical current begins flowing, which creates lightning. This flash temporarily equalises the charged regions, until the opposite charges build up again.\u00a0Upwards lightning is normally caused by a preceding flash moving from the cloud to Earth, and involves a bolt moving from the ground to the clouds . Upward lightning is typically classified into three groups. Starters extend up to an altitude of 19 miles (30km), jets extend to 31 miles (50km), and the gigantic jets reach up to 56 miles (90km). The upward movement in Mr Murray's image doesn't appear to extend this high, however, and storm chaser Dan Robinson said if part of a bolt is coming straight at you, it will appear to loop back on itself even when it's not . 'Most of the time you'll view a lightning channel from the side and it'll appear to travel in one general direction only. 'However, if that lightning bolt - or part of the lightning bolt - is coming straight at you, that is, you are looking at it from one end. It will appear to loop back on itself, sometimes even appearing go back upwards. 'The bright knots in a lightning channel you sometimes see in lightning photographs are the result of the same phenomenon - they are just smaller, tighter 'loops'. It appears brighter because there is more than one section of lightning channel 'overlapping' in the camera's frame.' The Met Office's lightning expert Sven-Erik Enno told MailOnline: 'On the particular photo it seems that the upper part of the channel may be pointed towards the observer. 'In such perspective the upward movement of the horizontal channel may be more amplified - the approaching horizontal channel seems to rise higher in the sky as approaching plane seems to rise higher above the horizon although its real altitude does not change.' The map above shows the average yearly counts of lightning flashes per square kilometer from 1995 to 2013. Areas with the fewest number of flashes each year are grey and purple; areas with the largest number of lightning flashes - as many as 150 per year per square kilometer (0.4 square miles) - are bright pink. The Democratic Republic of Congo was found to have the most over the period .",

A new plane design has revamped the areas where cabin crew can enjoy from rest and relaxation in flight, and it seems they have more space than any passengers. A slick bunk bed design has been unveiled by Zodiac Galleys Europe, giving staff a bed each and some privacy for a little shut-eye during long-haul flights. Scroll down for video . First class accommodation! Zodiac Aerospace have revealed their new designs for luxury sleeping quarters for cabin crew . The lower deck area aims to maximise the sense of space and privacy for flight attendants as they rest . Drawing on the help of 30 flight attendants from four different continents, their lower deck designs reveal an area designed to feel spacious, private and with maximum personal comfort. Every bunk is equipped with a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual comfort features such as an\u00a0in-flight entertainment and air conditioning system. In order to maximise the sense of space, innovative materials and lighting solutions were designed and implemented. The Zodiac Aerospace concept was revealed Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg last week, which aimed to showcase the latest developments in aircraft manufacturing. The company has been creating Lower Deck Mobile Crew Rests\u00a0for Airbus A330/A340 since the '90s and is the market leader for this area. Each section boasts a personal service unit (PSU) offering crew with individual  in-flight entertainment systems and air conditioning . They aimed to start from a clean slate  in order to create a new concept for sleeping areas, and conducted extensive market research to achieve this. 'The goal was not only to improve on quantitative aspects such as cost and weight, but also to enhance the user experience,' a spokesperson for Zodiac Aerospace stated to Skift. 'In every step of the process users were involved. 'The extensive research provided a thorough understanding of the factors which influence how users experience crew rests.' Cabin envy! The deluxe areas were created after Zodiac Aerospace spoke to\u00a030 flight attendants from four different continents . Last year other rare photographs revealed the tiny space quarters afforded to flight attendants on Boeing 373 Dreamliners. Unlike the Aerospace lower deck areas, the Boeing Crew Rest Departments (CRCs) can be located in a compartment at the top of the plane, or in a hidden section of the same cabin as passengers. Enough room to swing a cat? A file picture reveals the Crew Rest Department on board a Boeing 777 . On a Cathay Pacific 777-300ER there is a concealed staircase leading to the CRC at the rear of the plane. Attendants have to duck to get through it, but there is room for eight flight staff with six foot bunk beds with heavy curtains for blocking out noise from other crew members. Instructions state that one crew member can be on a bunk at a time, and never during taxi, take off and landing. When not in use, the secret door must be closed and latched to avoid passengers wandering in. Sleep tight: The cosy and comfortable looking crew sleeping quarters on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner .

    "source": "St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands (CNN)Government officials are trying to track down vacationers who stayed at villas in the Virgin Islands who may have been exposed to a deadly pesticide. Local officials said methyl bromide is suspected to have been used improperly several times in the U.S. Virgin Islands, in different parts of the island; even the governor said his condominium complex was fumigated with it in 2013, without his knowledge. Investigators are still trying to piece together exactly what happened at the Sirenusa resort, where a Delaware family's vacation in paradise turned into a nightmare. Theresa Devine and Steve Esmond and their two children fell gravely ill and suffered seizures; two brothers, ages 14 and 16, remain in comas. But this was likely not an isolated incident. Local authorities here tell CNN there is evidence methyl bromide was used at least twice at the gated Sirenusa resort on St. John by the pest control company Terminix.  They also say Terminix used the pesticide across the islands on different occasions. Dawn Henry, the commissioner designee of the local Department of Planning and Natural Resources, or DPNR, said that while investigating what happened, the agency found methyl bromide was likely also used last fall at the same Sirenusa resort, as well as in a vacation villa in St. Croix and in two nontourist locations. Methyl bromide is banned from indoor use, and is only approved as an agricultural pesticide. Other pest control companies on the Virgin Islands were found in possession of methyl bromide and officials said they are checking records to see whether it was used improperly. Ken Mapp, the governor of the Virgin Islands, said it was. \"What these companies did or appear to have been doing is clearly a violation of the law and they'll be held accountable for it,\"  Mapp said. He said he learned his own complex was fumigated with methyl bromide in 2013, but said there have been no additional reports of people falling ill. Authorities are trying to track down anyone who has stayed at the affected villas or who might have been exposed. Family slowly recovering from illness after Virgin Islands trip . Terminix issued a statement saying it is \"committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment\" and is \"looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities.\" When CNN visited the Terminix office on St. Thomas, which is corporate-owned, an employee refused to comment, and another employee closed the door. Henry said all canisters of methyl bromide known to exist in the area have been confiscated and will be shipped off-island for destruction as soon as possible. In the meantime, an attorney for Esmond and Devine said the family is still struggling. The two teenage boys remain in comas. Their father has regained consciousness and is slowly getting better. Devine is in better condition and is undergoing occupational therapy. DPNR, the local environmental agency, already had been under scrutiny. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has oversight, designated it \"high risk,\" saying the agency \"does not meet management standards.\" The EPA's inspector general is also investigating. According to the Department of Justice, a former commissioner and two DPNR directors have been sentenced to jail terms since 2008. That year, Dean C. Plaskett  was sentenced to nine years for receiving kickbacks in awarding local government contracts. In 2014, Roberto Tapia, the Justice Department said, pleaded guilty to using his position to engage in illegal drug trafficking while he was head of that same agency.  He was sentenced to 70 months in federal prison. In January, Mapp was sworn in and appointed Henry as a new designee to run the department, so it is under a new administration. A spokeswoman for the EPA said the DPNR has been cooperative in this investigation. She added that none of the troubles the agency has had are directly related to pesticide enforcement, but instead general practices. Mapp said the agency's problems have nothing to do with what happened to the Devine and Esmond's family. Instead, he blames the pesticide companies. \"It occurred because someone was cutting corners, thought they could enhance their profit margin and thought they could get away with it, and apparently in my own residence someone had been getting away with it for quite some time,\" Mapp said. Part of the investigation, he said, will be tracking whether the proper paperwork was filled out when the canisters were ordered, or if the pesticide was smuggled in. The Department of Justice is also investigating. \"If they purchased it and on these forms they said their use was for agriculture purposes, which is the only legal way they could use it, and then brought them into the territory and used them in commercial and residential buildings, that's a clear and malice violation of the law,\" Mapp said.",

Wedding season is upon us and for brides on a budget, there's plenty of ways to save thousands of pounds on your special day . 1. GO BIG: Rather than having lots of smaller tables, seat your guests on larger tables. Not only will they get to know more people, you'll save money by having to purchases fewer centerpieces and tablecloths. 2. SAVVY SHOPPING: When seeking decor, shop out of season. Black vases will be on sale after Halloween, red and gold after Christmas and pink after Valentine's Day. Also, money saving sites such as Groupon actually offer entire wedding day packages occasionally. 3. CUT ON BAR COSTS: Not only will an open bar end up in a rather messy evening, it will also leave a dent in your bank account. Instead of letting guests order expensive shots and spirits, offer beer, wine and a signature cocktail - that way, there's something for everyone without unnecessary drinking and spending. 4. CALL ON YOUR FRIENDS: Rather than source expensive florists and stationery experts, reach out to your most talented friends. Among your and your groom's wider circle of friends, there is bound to be someone who has beautiful handwriting and someone who is green-fingered. When seeking decor, shop out of season. Black vases will be on sale after Halloween, red and gold after Christmas and pink after Valentine's Day and don't be afraid to search sites like Etsy and even eBay . 5. DO HIRE A PLANNER: Most people steer clear of wedding planners to save on extra costs but, whilst it may seem counter-intuitive to pay for help, wedding planners have a good network of suppliers, know how much they should be paying for something and aren't afraid of bargaining. 6. SHOP THE SUPERMARKET: You may have your heart set on those iconic Vera Wang bridesmaid dresses but George at Asda is hoping to help brides on a budget - by launching a wedding collection for bridesmaids and pageboys starting from just \u00a37. Dubbed 'the most affordable range anywhere on the high street', the supermarket claim that it's half the price of rivals such as Debenhams and Next and is a 'saviour for cash-strapped brides-to-be'.

Sure to get your guests in the party spirit, all you need to get the party started is a computer, microphone and a projector with a screen. 8. GO ONLINE: If the costs of invitations and postage are something you aren't willing to splurge on, create your own website and share all the details of your big day online. Rather than hiring an expensive make-up artist, call on the students at your local college to do your bridal beauty . 9. GO TO THE GROWER: When sourcing beautiful flowers, cut out the middleman by calling on a grower. Farmers and the Soil Association may well be able to help you source your foliage for dirt cheap. 10. USE A TRAINEE: If you have your heart set on having your make-up done professionally, rather than hiring an artist, call on the students at your local college. 11. SAMPLE SIZE: If you're doing your make-up yourself, visit a make-up counter for tips and only buy only the items you'll definitely use again. For the things you'll only use on the day, scoop up the samples. 12. SOMETHING BORROWED: Rather than splashing the cash on expensive accessories and jewellery, borrow a few items from the women you love. Grandmother's bracelet, your mother's ring and your best friend's earrings will imbue the big day with even greater meaning. 13. GO SUPERSIZE: If you're not keen on the idea of a three-course meal, serve a family-style buffet on each table. Huge pasta dishes, massive salads and big rice bowls will not only cut costs but also serve as an icebreaker and act as a centerpiece. 14. ASK YOUR GUESTS TO STAND:\u00a0Consider a standing ceremony if you're tying the knot outside to save on renting chairs. Plus, it will cut down the time of the wedding and thus cost. 15. \u00a0SKIP THE BREAD BASKET: What sounds like such a simple tip will actually bring the cost down a lot. No bread means less cutlery, butter and expenditure.",

The threat against flight 826 from Cologne Bonn to Milan's Malpensa airport was received on Sunday evening. The tower in Cologne immediately alerted the pilot of the Airbus A320 (file picture of Germanwings plane) The threat was emailed to the airport 15 minutes before the plane's scheduled departure, prompting police to set the necessary measures in motion. Instead of taking off the pilot steered the plane to a different part of the airport where passengers and crew were evacuated. A total of 132 people were aboard the plane, including 126 passengers and six crew members, Spiegel-Online reported. A thorough search was carried out and federal police said sniffer dogs found no sign of explosives, news agency DPA reported. The threat was received just as the pilot was taxiing along the runway at Cologne Bonn Airport (pictured) An examination of the baggage and the aircraft itself also yielded no results Germanwings said in a separate statement later on Sunday evening.

Lufthansa has faced questions about its pilot screening process since the March 24 crash which appears to have been caused by the plane's co-pilot who deliberately steered the plane into a mountain. The Airbus A320 went down in a remote region of the French Alps en route to Dusseldorf from Barcelona. Recordings from the flight data recorder suggest co-pilot Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before 'deliberately' crashing the jet.

Spurs are sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which would bring European qualification, but there has been talk in the past that Europe's second-tier competition does them more harm than good. Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying\u00a0outweigh\u00a0the negatives, though, and admits that the prospect of Europa\u00a0League football played a big part when he decided to move to White Hart Lane in 2013. Christian Eriksen has warned Tottenham they will struggle to attract top players if they miss out on Europe . Eriksen says the benefits of qualifying for the much-maligned Europa League outweigh the negatives . The lack of Champions League football - which Spurs have missed out on since the 2010-11 season - is seen as a barrier to signing top-class players for clubs of Tottenham's size, but Eriksen says missing out on the Europa League would have the same effect. 'Is it a factor when the club are trying to sign players? I think so,' Eriksen said. 'It certainly was for me when I moved from Ajax two years ago. 'I always want to play in Europe, to be seen on that stage or in the Premier League. It was a big chance and for me it was a nice thing when I came to Tottenham.' Tottenham have been linked with Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin and Dynamo Kiev forward Andriy Yarmolenko, and Eriksen worries that Spurs could have to lower their sights if they are not on the European stage next season. Mauricio Pochettino's side currently sit sixth in the Barclays Premier League, which is enough to qualify . Eriksen says the lure of Europa League football was important in his decision to join Spurs back in 2013 . And while he admits that missing out makes finishing higher up the table easier, Eriksen doesn't see many issues with the competition itself. 'I'd rather play in Europe than nothing,' he told the Evening Standard. 'There are many games, of course, but if you have a big squad as we have, it shouldn't be a disappointment to play in Europe. A lot of players want to be in Europe. We've been fighting to get into the top four and we still have a little chance. Florian Thauvin (right), the Marseille midfielder, is one player who has been linked with a move to Spurs . Dynamo Kiev's Andriy  Yarmolenko is thought to be another target for Tottenham in the summer market . 'Of course, it is easier to get into the top four if you are not in Europe. There are so many games and we have played more games than most teams in the Premier League this season.' As it stands, the Premier League's top six will all qualify for Europe but if Arsenal win the FA Cup final against Aston Villa that number would extend to the seventh-placed side. West Ham could also find themselves in the Europa League next season if they qualify via the Fair Play Table.",

A number of online retailers stock the offending garments, which feature phrases such as  'I heart my stalker' and 'Some people call it stalking. I call it love!' According to the SLT, the T-shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women, and play into people's fear of being laughed at, which prevents victims from seeking help to deal with stalkers and puts them at a higher risk of being attacked. Scroll down for video . Funny? A selection of T-shirts (pictured) branded with jokes about stalking has been slammed by The Suzy Lamplugh Trust, a charity which aims to 'make society a safer place' The T-shirts in question are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle, Look Human and North Shore Shirts. 'Are you stalking me? 'Cause that would be super', reads one, priced at $10.99 (\u00a37.40) in the US. 'I stalk you on Facebook', another states, priced at \u00a316.95 ($25.35). 'Stalking is when Channing Tatum and I go for long romantic walk together but only one of us knows about it', another $28 (\u00a318.90) specimen muses. 'Stalking is such a strong word, I prefer intense research of an individual,' reads a $27 (\u00a318.11) shirt, featuring the  description: 'Sometimes when you want to bag a mate you have to do some reconnaissance.' A spokesman from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust told MailOnline that these common slogans seem harmless but they prevent the crime from being taken seriously. She said: 'It does all add to the feeling that it\u2019s something that\u2019s a little bit humorous. It\u2019s not, especially for victims. Making light: According to the SLT, the T-shirts mock a serious issue which affects one in six women, and play into people's fear of being laughed at, which prevents victims from seeking help with stalkers . 'If we're  still making jokes about stalking it\u2019s harder for victims to come forward. 'Things are sold with humour but when they\u2019re so commonplace they start to dilute the language around them it starts to become a problem and stalking is a serious offense. 'It doesn\u2019t help that the messages are out there, it just reinforces the myths that are around stalking.' She added: 'Even the language around stalking is potentially damaging, we all talk about stalking people on Facebook but we don\u2019t mean it, we mean we\u2019re looking up someone we went to school with. She said a common view of stalking is that it's romantic, with stalkers leaving bunches of flowers, teddy bears or money on victims' windscreens. 'The behaviours may not seem offensive in that way but if it\u2019s unwanted attention from someone, it\u2019s a problem.' Offending articles: The T-shirts in question are sold in US and UK stores including Zazzle, Look Human (pictured) and North Shore Shirts . In honour of National Stalking Awareness Week, which started on Monday, the personal safety charity, which runs the National Stalking Helpline, has released a two-minute animated film to help shift the public's, at times, blas\u00e9 perspective on the matter. The video's voiceover states: 'What does stalking actually mean? 'It doesn't just mean a stranger ambushing you from the bushes or lurking through the window. 'It can also mean disturbing emails, non-stop phone calls, creepy letters and social media abuse. It means the other person ignores your \"no\". 'It means you're forced to change your life routine for months or even years. 'Oh, and it's not flattering or funny, it's a serious crime. 'So if you're being followed, if there are eyes on you wherever you go, if you are scared to open the door or your mailbox or your text messages, if you jump every time the phone rings, if you haven't had a good night's sleep for a very long time... then this is stalking.' According to the campaign - which seeks to challenge the notion that stalking is 'romantic, trivial or funny' - 80 per cent of victims are women, and more than 80 per cent of men and women combined are stalked by someone they know. Of this, 45 per cent of stalkers are ex-partners, 22 per cent are 'acquaintances', five per cent are colleagues or ex-colleagues, and four per cent are family members. 'It is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims,' the trust explains. Serious crime: 'It is hard to give an exact definition of stalking because stalkers will often use multiple and differing methods to harass their victims,' the SLT explains (picture posed by model) 'Stalking can consist of any type of behaviour, such as regularly sending flowers or gifts, making unwanted or malicious communication (including calls, texts and emails), damaging property and physical or sexual assault. 'If the behaviour is persistent, unwanted and is causing you fear, harassment or anxiety then it is stalking and you should not have to live with it.' The SLT was set up by Diana Lamplugh, the late mother of Suzy, a 25-year-old estate agent who disappeared in Fulham, south west London, in 1986. She was presumed murdered and declared dead in 1993, and no one has ever been charged over her killing.

Scientists at the Shadow Robot Company spent almost 18 years developing the hands, which are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors. According to its creators, the arms can chop, stir, whisk and baste well enough to recreate almost anything you would care to eat, whether it is a simple home-cooked supper, or an elaborate concoction designed by a world-class chef. The hands move a little slowly, hovering strangely above the work surface whenever they are not busy, but they imitate human movements closely enough that they can do things such as wipe a spoon on the edge of a pan to prevent drips. The device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen, priced at around \u00a310,000 ($14,000), which includes an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink. Engineers at the Shadow Robot Company spent almost 18 years developing the hands, which are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors.

But last year, after Russian engineer Mark Oleynik from Moley Robotics approached the team with the notion of turning the hands into an everyday household gadget, the concept of the robot chef was born. Kitchen revolution: A robot in the Robotic Kitchen prototype created by the Shadow Robot Company cooks a crab  soup at the company's booth at the world's largest industrial technology fair, the Hannover Messe . Working away: The robotic hands are each governed by 24 motors, 26 micro-controllers and 129 sensors . Even if there are a few splatters, it shouldn\u2019t matter - the gadget will load the dishwasher and wipe down the work surfaces afterwards. The arms will tuck up out of the way when not in use, making space for their owners to get their own hands dirty. Mr Oleynik, who is spearheading the project, said: \u2018All the things which are possible with the hand are possible here. There is no limitation. The \u00a310,000 ($14,000) device will be sold from as early as 2017 as part of a purpose-built high-tech kitchen which includes an oven, hob, dishwasher and sink . Bon app\u00e9tit: Chef Tim Anderson checks crab soup prepared by the 'robot chef' at  the Hannover Messe, in Hanover earlier today . \u2018A lot of people want to go to Michelin-starred restaurants, but they are quite expensive and may be quite far from the home. This is an opportunity for people to enjoy very good food, and for a reasonable price.\u2019 The only cuisine that is off the robot\u2019s menu at the moment is sushi, which requires exceedingly steady pressure and nimble fingers to make, but the team plan to conquer that as well by the time it goes on sale. By that point, they claim, users will be able to order meals from an iTunes-style library of recipes devised by professional chefs, making it possible to tuck into Michelin-standard food on a daily basis. People will also be able to train the robotic arms to cook their own favourite family recipes, by demonstrating them a few times while wearing high-tech gloves and wrist-bands. Users will be able to \u2018order\u2019 dinner on their way home, or breakfast for when they wake up, using an app on their smartphone, picking recipes depending on the ingredients they have in stock. They will also be able to choose dishes based on their nutritional content. And just in case, the unit has emergency equipment if there\u2019s a fire.",

    "source": "Los Angeles (CNN)She's one of the hottest and most successful Latinas in Hollywood, but now Sofia Vergara is playing defense in a legal battle initiated by her ex-fiance: He wants to keep the two frozen embryos from their relationship, both female. The 42-year-old actress and star of the hit TV sitcom \"Modern Family\" split from businessman Nick Loeb in May 2014. Loeb is suing the Colombian-born actress in Los Angeles to prevent Vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in November 2013, according to published reports by New York Daily News and In Touch magazine. The lawsuit cited by the two publications, however, lists the plaintiff as \"Joe Doe\" and the defendant as \"Jane Doe.\" The suit doesn't identify the names of the actual litigants. Instead, the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals' privacy. The two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports. On Tuesday, Loeb's attorney Abram Moore confirmed in a statement that Loeb filed the lawsuit. Representatives for Vergara declined to comment. Court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged, and their plan was to eventually have children together. On \"Modern Family,\" Vergara plays Gloria Delgado Pritchett, an eccentric and voluptuous Colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby. But the sitcom make-believe is far from what Vergara is dealing with now. The lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by Jane Doe until both parties reach an agreement. The suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held, the Art Reproductive Center in Beverly Hills. The center didn't respond to a message seeking comment Friday. According to the legal paperwork, the ex-couple had already used two surrogate mothers, one being a close friend of Jane Doe's, in an attempt to have children. However, neither of the implantations was successful. In his own statement, Loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term, but he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. His statement doesn't directly identify Vergara as the donor, other than referring to his \"ex.\" \"I have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex, and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future, should she change her mind,\" Loeb said. He believes that \"life begins at fertilization,\" he said. \"Creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations, even where a man doesn't want to become a father. Where a man does want to become a father, and wants to impose no obligations on the other party, he should have that corresponding right.  However life comes to be created, it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent,\" Loeb said. In an interview with ABC in April 2013, while the couple was still engaged, Vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it. \"We just wanted to plan ahead. My boyfriend Nick is three years younger than me and he's never had a son. I have my son, Manolo, so it's not that import(ant)... you know, it's not like an emergency for me to have another kid. For Nick, yes, because he's never had a baby,\" Vergara said. During the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with Loeb. \"I already froze some eggs so, you know, I wanted to take advantage of science. Why not?\" Vergara said. The ABC anchor asked Vergara how far along she was in the process, to which the actress replied: \"I took them out already. They're in a refrigerator.\" Laughing, she added, \"Hopefully they'll be fresh by the time I use them.\" The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. \"Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use,\" he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said. \"The documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners,\" he said. \"In the scenario where there's a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to, it will usually be decided by a court of law.\" But experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues. \"Religious, moral issues, to legal and contract issues. When does life begin? Are these embryos alive?\" said California attorney Vance Owen. \"To Catholics, for example, conception marks the beginning of life. To abortion advocates, the child has to be in a more advanced state, perhaps the third trimester, so it's a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues,\" Owen said. Owen said Loeb has a case because no court in California will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree. \"This case is a gray area of law because it's new,\" Owen said. \"It's developing as we speak,\" he said. \"It's a question, I think, of whether to decide if these frozen (embryos)are human beings or whether they are property. Since they are unborn, some states in the United States look at these (embryos) not as life, but as property.\" Owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by Loeb will now open new issues, and a California court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong. \"These embryos are not inside her body,\" he said. \"They are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in Beverly Hills, so there the Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri vs. Danforth case cannot be used by the Sofia Vergara team to allege that the (embryos) would present some danger to her health as they did in that case.\" In that case, the U.S. Supreme Court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional. The lawsuit comes as Vergara promotes her new movie, \"Hot Pursuit,\" with co-star Reese Witherspoon. Vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor Joe Manganiello. CNN's Krecyte Villarreal and Stella Chan contributed to this report.",

A woman accused a married couple of rape after her boyfriend found out she had a threesome with them in a Travelodge hotel room. Hannah McWhirter, 21, of Banff, Aberdeenshire, engaged in the m\u00e9nage a trois with co-worker Dionne Clark and her husband Shaun in July 2013. She even exchanged texts with the couple after their threesome telling them how much she enjoyed herself. But when Mr Clark told the John Lewis department store worker's boyfriend about their hookup she claimed she had been raped. McWhirter appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court yesterday where she admitted wasting police time with false rape claims. Fiscal depute Elaine Ward said the accused had become close friends with Mrs Clark, 29, after starting work in the same shop in January 2013. The court heard that over time Mrs Clark introduced McWhirter to her husband Shaun, 35. Mrs Ward said: 'Both Mr and Mrs Clark and the accused spent a lot of time together socially and exchanged texts and other media messages on a daily basis. 'The nature of their relationship became more intimate and in June 2013 they discussed having a threesome and booking a hotel for that purpose.' The court heard that on July 13 the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out, oblivious to what was going on. Mrs Ward said: 'On the following day the accused and Mrs Clark exchanged several text messages saying that they had enjoyed the previous night.' The fiscal depute said McWhirter and the Clarks continued to meet socially and appeared 'happy' in each other's company. McWhirter accused co-worker Dionne Clark and husband Shaun (pictured) of rape following the threesome . The court heard the three met up in a Travelodge in Aberdeen while McWhirter's boyfriend was on a night out . But the relationship started to deteriorate after McWhirter took a day to respond to a text from Mrs Clark about being admitted to hospital. Bosses at their work later found out about the incident but McWhirter denied that the threesome had happened during a meeting in September 2013. The court heard that a month later things took a turn for the worst. Mrs Ward said: 'On October 11, the accused's boyfriend was standing outside her place of work when Mr Clark advised him of the threesome and showed him text messages from the accused. 'This later resulted in the accused being confronted by her boyfriend. 'She initially denied that the incident had taken place, then admitted it but said it was forced.' The court heard their relationship ended and McWhirter returned to live with her mother - continuing to claim that the Clarks had raped her. McWhirter has now admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark (pictured on their wedding day) to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14 2013 . Police then began investigating her claims. McWhirter claimed she had been on a night out with friends before bumping into Mr and Mrs Clark. Mrs Ward said: 'She stated that at the end of the night she had to use the bathroom so went to their hotel room and then gave police details of a forcible rape.' The Clarks were interviewed under caution by police on October 16. However McWhirter's friends did not back up her night out story. After further mobile phone analysis took place in November 2013, McWhirter admitted she had been a willing participant. Yesterday she admitted wasting police time and rendering Mr and Mrs Clark to suspicion under the sexual offences act between October 13 and November 14, 2013. Sheriff Graham Buchanan deferred sentence until next month for the preparation of reports. McWhirter, who was released on bail, wept as she left the dock yesterday.",

    "source": "After two months and more than 100 witnesses, the prosecution has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside\u00a0Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate\u00a0as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.",

    "source": "Two Ukip council candidates have been taken to school by a teacher who covered their sloppy election leaflet in corrections - but they claim it is a dirty tricks campaign. Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, has embarrassed husband and wife team Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook over their spelling, punctuation and grammar. In one section Mr Tanswell and Ms Snook promise that Ukip will 'take back control of our boarders' - so the teacher wrote in red: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house'. Scroll down for video . Back to school: A teacher has taken her red pen to an error-strewn Ukip leaflet that landed on her doormat . Back to basics: The teacher picked up on the use of boarders and wrote: 'I think you mean borders, not residents of a school or guest house' In their leaflet the councillors  also tell prospective voters: 'If you vote Ukip your get Ukip' - so the marker wrote: 'You'll?'. One handwritten note about the leaflet's opening paragraph says: 'This 'sentence' is long and obscure. It needs some punctuation if it is to make sense'. The Ukip candidates, from Frome, Somerset, defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May, having left the Lib Dems to improve their chances. Expert: Suzy Howlett, 54, who specialises in teaching foreign-born children English, took her red pen to the leaflet and sent it to her children . Mr Tanswell today said his former party have 'hacked' his emails for information to create a slapdash  leaflet to scupper their election hopes, and has called in police. However,  a party source has suggested the leaflet is genuine. He said: 'They had to rewrite everything and it looks like they didn't have time to spell check it.' Mrs Howlett, a specialist teacher with 32 years' experience, told MailOnline she enjoyed a 'happy two minutes' correcting their work. Using a red pen she highlighted the incorrect use of words, lack of apostrophes, flabby language, poor spellings and use of Americanisms. Their error-strewn Ukip leaflet has been shared thousands of times online. Mrs Howlett said: 'I marked it during a happy two minutes last night. I had heard about the leaflet from friends and my husband brought home a copy and straight away I told him I was eager to take a red pen to it. 'The part about borders - or boarders - \u00a0really made me laugh. I took a picture of my work and my children, Lucy and George, were very amused by it. They posted it to their friends, and it took off. 'I teach children who speak English as an additional language and advise other teachers about how to help them. There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar. Some of my nearest and dearest have a few issues at times, and I am certainly not poking fun at dyslexia. 'But what I am saying is that there is a problem when people don't recognise their own shortcomings. 'I have not met the candidates, but the leaflet suggests that if you can't check something like this properly, how can you run something properly if you were to be elected. 'I am most certainly not going to vote Ukip, absolutely not, but I will not say who I will be voting for. 'I won't discuss (Ukip) policies, I will just say that the children I work with are a delight, and some of them could teach Mr Tanswell a thing or two about apostrophes'. Election campaign:\u00a0Derek Tanswell and Sharon Snook, left and right, \u00a0defected to Nigel Farage's party two weeks ago and hope to be re-elected in May . Hint: This bullet point lacks the necessary apostrophe in one of more than 20 corrections . Lost in translation: A key section to persuade voters to back them next month also backfired . Changes: Mrs Hewlett suggested in her red notes 'try not to keep using apostrophes for plurals' A picture of the annotated leaflet has spread across the internet after it was posted on Reddit by a user who said a mother of a friend had marked it after finding it on her doormat. The leaflet also boasted about Snook and Tanswell's campaigning which led to the creation of ten free parking spaces at the local Cattle Market car park. Mr. Tanswell says the Liberal Democrats have put out the leaflet to 'stitch him up'. He said 'They have been hacking into my emails, the Liberal Democrats. They've hacked it all and I have the police looking at it now. 'It's the Liberal Democrats who are doing it all. They've hacked into my emails, they've basically got hold my stuff, they are producing it, they are sending it out, they are doing everything they can. 'I'm receiving about 20, 30 phone calls before 12 o'clock today threatening to kill me. The police are on to all of that'. Mr. Tanswell, 48, who runs a plumbing and heating company, added: 'I used to be a Liberal Democrat councillor. 'About a month ago, I left the Liberal Democrats to go UKIP and obviously a lot of them don't like it, so they are producing stuff like [the flyer] and putting it out and putting my name to it. 'I spoke to the police this morning. They are worried about it because people are making threats to kill me and stuff. Supportive: Mrs Howlett says she was not poking fun, adding: 'There is no shame in having difficulties with spelling, punctuation and grammar' 'They believe the propaganda from the national parties, like the Liberal party are saying that UKIP are racist. That's not true. They don't like it. 'I was a Liberal Democrat councillor and I've gone to UKIP - they don't like that. These people are very vindictive. 'I don't know who the death threats are coming from but the police are investigating it now. 'The Liberal Democrats have put all that s*** out about me. They've stuck a load of stuff on my Facebook, they hacked into that.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said this afternoon: \u2018The idea that the Liberal Democrats had anything to do with Cllr Tanswell\u2019s absurd allegations is categorically untrue. 'Liberal Democrats take the accusation that the party was involved in illegal activity such as the hacking of emails seriously, and the local party is exploring its options.\u2019 Mrs Howlett asked MailOnline to include a link\u00a0to the charity Against Malaria, recommended by the charity Effective Altruism, which her son George, 24, volunteers for.",

I don\u2019t just want to scratch, I want to rake my nails across my scalp and draw blood. Feelings of well-being evaporate and my stomach lurches. I edge away from my unsuspecting friends.

My eyes narrow, those flowing locks are the enemy \u2014 a breeding ground for the bane of my life: pediculus humanus capitis, or head lice (a nit is the egg sac laid by the female louse on the hair shaft of their human hosts). I have had nits at least 100 times. Never as a child, but as an adult it has been one infestation after another. I should stress I wash my hair pretty much every day and have no other body-borne parasites, such as fleas \u2014 but my scalp is El Dorado for lice.

A week later I was sitting in the university library opposite a boy I had a crush on. Our eyes met, he smiled, I grinned back then scratched my head. I heard something hit the paper I was taking notes on, and there on the page of white A4 was an object the size of an eyelash, with six wriggling legs. Dais (pictured as a child) says she was never affected by head lice when she was younger, only getting them for the first time when she was 19 . It was my first sighting of a live louse. I ran to the nearest chemist and doused my head with the industrial-strength chemicals that were then usual treatment for nits. I didn\u2019t tell anyone, I was too embarrassed, but made sure the next time I saw my sisters I kept them at arm\u2019s length. I don\u2019t know if the boy in the library saw the nit fall from my head \u2014 in my memory it was the size of a small mouse \u2014 but somehow I never found myself sitting opposite him again. In retrospect, I think he may have been giving me a wide berth. After a few nit-free years in my early 20s, my relationship with the parasites resumed when I became a mother. It\u2019s a rite of passage for most parents of primary school children. The note comes home with them in the homework folder, announcing that nits have been found in the class and would parents please check their children\u2019s heads for the critters and treat them accordingly? Easier said than done, as nits are masters of disguise \u2014 it takes 20:20 vision or a very high-powered magnifying glass to spot a live one. It\u2019s much easier to pinpoint the eggs, tell-tale white flecks that cling to the hair shaft. Daisy (pictured) was lucky to have a few nit-free years in her early twenties but didn't escape the parasites entirely as they returned when she had children . My eldest daughter began school in 1996, and a nit invasion swiftly followed. They leapt with enthusiasm from her head to mine, and back again \u2014 completely ignoring the head of my husband \u2014 leading me to spend a small fortune on louse-busting treatments. This sector of the pharmaceutical market is worth \u00a3185 million a year in the UK, and I know why. As those who have experienced it know, nit-combing is the closest most mums get to being a gorilla, grooming its offspring for fleas. When my daughters were young (they are now 24 and 14) I would regularly grab them by their lustrous locks and scrutinise their scalps for those tiny flecks. \u2018Oh Mum,\u2019 they would complain, \u2018lay off, there\u2019s nothing there.\u2019 But I knew better. I had seen the scratching and I could feel the prickle on my own scalp. Their heads and mine were five-star hotels for head lice and no sooner had I eliminated one nit invasion, another would follow. Daisy (pictured as a child) says you can win the battle with headlice but you can never win the war . Nits are the Forth Bridge of infestations, no sooner have you spent a good half-day combing the hair of a wriggling eight-year-old, than you have to do it all over again, and again and again. I have tried everything, and I mean everything to get rid of them. Chemicals, suffocation, endless combing \u2014 there was even a point where I made my daughters put on hats when they came home from school so I wouldn\u2019t get them. But there is no way to avoid them. The only thing I haven\u2019t done is to shave their heads \u2014 or mine. You can win the battle against head lice with nit combs and conditioner and weekly combings, but you can never, ever win the war. Relax your vigilance for a millisecond and they are back. Christmas is peak time for nits in my experience \u2014 all that conviviality is party-time for the critters. Over the past ten years, I must have spent at least five festive mornings hovering over my daughters with a nit comb, squeaking with horror as I extract yet another fat troublesome specimen from their hair. Pretty much every foreign holiday I have taken in 15 years has involved one shaming incident where I have to mime the action of headlice in a foreign chemist\u2019s shop \u2014 in Italy they are called pidocchi, in Germany, kopflause. What the Thai word for them is I do not know, but I do know that scratching your head in a Bangkok chemist will give you some pretty powerful stuff. I once missed a New Year\u2019s Eve party in France because the local pharmacist told me to douse my head in olive oil overnight and then wash it off with Coca-Cola. Desperate for a solution, I followed her advice and ended up with hedgehog hair that took a week to return to normal. The worst experience was a holiday in Ireland with my best friend who has a head of expensively highlighted hair. After a week with me and my daughters, her head started to itch. The only remedy available in the pharmacy at Schull, Co Cork, was so pungent it turned her ash tints a dull green. We are still friends \u2014 just. I thought that when my second daughter left primary school four-and-a-half years ago my nit ordeal would end, but no \u2014 it appears head lice are just as virulent among teens as they are among younger children. My nephews and nieces have become resigned to their aunt doing a quick once over when they visit \u2014 if I could install the head lice equivalent of a sheep dip, believe me I would. Daisy (pictured) thought she was safe when her youngest daughter left primary school but it seems that headlice are just as\u00a0virulent among teens as they are among younger children . When my daughters were young, I would quite often have a quick snoop over the scalps of their visiting friends just to check. Sadly, that isn\u2019t an option with teenagers \u2014 peering at adolescent scalps is a human rights issue. Understandably, I have accumulated quite a bit of knowledge about nits in my near 30-year relationship with them. I have discovered, for example, that not many grown men seem to get them. Could that be a hormonal thing or is it because men don\u2019t get down with the kids as much as women (nits can\u2019t fly but they can jump downwards, so you never want to sit below a potentially nit-infested child). In New York, the louse-infested head straight to the nit pickers of Crown Heights \u2014 Hasidic Jews who comb every hair until they have eliminated them. Over here, there is a thriving service called The Hairforce, which will come to your house and de-infest the whole family. But it\u2019s not cheap (close to \u00a31,500 for a family of four, including two home visits) and if you get them as often as I do, you would be bankrupt. According to Richard J. Pollack, the only failsafe solution is to avoid all physical contact with other people as the nits can only jump a very short distance from head-to-head . My only comfort has been assuming that my attractiveness to head lice is something to do with having super-powerful feminine pheromones, which made me irresistible to both men and the pesky pediculus genus. Yet according to Richard J. Pollack, senior environmental public health officer at Harvard University, that is not the case. Head lice do not discriminate, he insists: \u2018Scalp hair is a prerequisite. Being alive is another \u2014 they won\u2019t infest corpses. Head lice only infest human beings.\u2019 Pollack says regular infestation in adults is rare, happening in less than 1 per cent of cases. His website, identify.us.com, has all the latest research on nits. But even he can\u2019t explain why I\u2019m a nit magnet. The only failsafe solution, he says, is to avoid all physical contact with other people; nits can only jump a very short distance from head-to-head. Of course, now I have told the world about my nit problem, that might not be a problem!",

    "source": "(CNN)The United States has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in Indiana, where its new Religious Freedom Restoration Act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people. Such state laws have been growing ever since the U.S. Religious Freedom Restoration Act became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from \"substantially burdening\" a person's exercise of religion. So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state RFRAs are \"exceedingly rare,\" and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not Christian denominations, experts say. \"There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers,\" wrote Wayne State University law professor Christopher Lund in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an IRS accountant to a tea from the Amazon: . He was a Native American with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006, Robert Soto and Michael Russell attended an American Indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal Eagle Protection Act, which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground. Soto, a Lipan Apache, asserted he was participating in an Indian religious ceremony. The feathers are sacred to Native Americans. But a federal Fish and Wildlife Service agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and Soto surrendered his feathers. Russell, who is married to Soto's sister, isn't American Indian and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the America Bar Association Journal. Soto, however, petitioned the federal Interior Department to return his feathers. The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe. Soto and Russell sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's First Amendment assertions and their claims under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the same 1993 statute that Indiana legislators used in developing their new state law. But last August, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal RFRA. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to Soto. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute Soto and his congregants, so Soto is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal RFRA, said Luke Goodrich, Soto's attorney who's with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. A tea used by a Brazilian faith is to them like wine used by Catholics at communion, but U.S. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the Amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. The religion is a Christian spiritist faith that originated in Brazil and includes Amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions. About 140 members of the church live in the United States and use the tea in a sacred communion. In May 1999, U.S. Customs agents entered the church headquarters in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and seized all of its hoasca. The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for American Indians to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies. In fact, the federal RFRA was designed partly to protect the Native Americans' use of peyote, said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \"They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and Congress wanted to make sure it was protected,\" Toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law. The Uniao do Vegetal, which means \"the union of the plants,\" cited that federal law in suing the federal government. \"The government has never explained why it has accommodated The Native American Church's use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the UDV's use of hoasca,\" the church said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use. \"The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the Controlled Substances Act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under RFRA,\" the court ruling said. Bruce Rich, an Orthodox Jewish prisoner in Florida, wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no. So Rich sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law. Rich, 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely \"retaliation against the kosher inmates\" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate, Rich won an appeal before the 11th Circuit Court, which cited \"the defendant's meager efforts to explain why Florida's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in Florida.\" Recently baptized in the Sikh faith, Kawal Tagore went to her job with the IRS in Houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved. Tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a \"dangerous weapon\" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace. Tagore sued the government under the federal law. Tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the Newar Law Firm and the Becket Fund. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of Tagore's trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the Christian Science Monitor reported. Tagore's attorneys described the settlement as \"a groundbreaking policy allowing Sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings,\" they said in a statement. Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory. In Chicago, an association of 40 churches called the Civil Liberties for Urban Believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones. The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed. In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved. So the pastors sued the city of Chicago in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the Illinois religious freedom statute, the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act and the U.S. Constitution. But in 2003, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their RLUIPA claim. Defeated, church leaders were angry. \"The forty (40) churches in C.L.U.B. and certainly people of all faiths throughout Chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act passed unanimously by Congress in 2000,\" Apostle Theodore Wilkinson, the group's chairman, said in a statement. \"Also alarming is the court's conclusion that Chicago's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws. The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing,\" he said. At the same time, the city of Chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid \"the threat of heightened scrutiny under RLUIPA,\" according to a League of California Cities report in 2002. CNN's Alexandra Meeks contributed to this report.",

Moments after the Labour leader finished speaking, fans took to Twitter to coo adoringly about his 'sexy grey tie' and his smouldering looks. One rather breathless Tweet read: 'Miliband is totally talking to me and no one else, you sexy beast. Keep staring down the camera Ed! #leadersdebate' Scroll down for video . So hot right now: Ed Miliband's looks proved a hit with Twitter users during last night's debate . Another, Holly Ashby, asked why no one had asked Mr Miliband a question about his hair, complaining: . 'Why has no one asked about Ed Miliband's sexy Rogue-From-X-Men grey streak? It's all I care about tbh.' One fan even likened Miliband to Hansel, a character from modelling comedy Zoolander, tweeting: . 'Ed seducing the ladies with his patter. He's so hot right now, just like Hansel #leadersdebate #zoolander' Another, named Chloeee, added: 'Ed Miliband really is hot.' Shortly afterwards, a Vine of Mr Miliband smouldering sultrily into the camera took the internet by storm, while popular website Buzzfeed took note of the phenomenon and published a piece rounding up the best romantic Tweets. But Mr Miliband, 45, who spent the day after the debate in Blackpool with his family, isn't the first politician to find himself on the receiving end of attention based on his good looks. Family day out: Mr Miliband has spent the day enjoying fish and chips with his family in Blackpool . On the campaign trail: Mr Miliband was canvassing for votes and drafted in his wife and sons to help out . Making his point: It wasn't just Mr Miliband's looks that got viewers talking . Impressed: A viewer finds herself enjoying the sight of Mr Miliband's saturnine looks . Enjoying it: Two watching women compare their notes on the Labour leader . Favourite bit: One Twitter user declared her love for Mr Miliband's 'Rogue-From-X-Men' grey streak . Handsome: Another Twitter user was surprised to find herself fancying the Labour leader . Last October, Swedish health minister Gabriel Wikstr\u00f6m, 30, found himself bombarded by risqu\u00e9 messages from adoring Turkish fans after making a visit to the country. Nicknamed 'the handsome minister' by his growing legion of fans, Wikstr\u00f6m, a Social Democrat who holds the position of Public Health Minister, said at the time that he was 'honoured' by all the attention. Speaking to English language Swedish daily newspaper, The Local, he said: 'I can\u2019t feel anything but honoured and glad. And a little bit surprised, I must admit.' Denmark's prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, 48, is another politician famous for her glamorous looks, while her 39-year-old agriculture minister, Dan J\u00f8rgensen, has also proved a hit with the ladies. Impressed: Viewers appeared to appreciate Mr Miliband's 'sexy tie' and the grey streak in his hair . Seductive: Another compared Mr Miliband to Hansel from Zoolander, adding: 'He's so hot right now' Was it deliberate? One Twitter user appeared less convinced by Mr Miliband's smoulder . Swoon: A Twitter user describes Mr Miliband as a 'sexy beast' and exhorts him to keep looking at the camera . Sexy MP: Swedish health minister\u00a0Gabriel Wikstr\u00f6m has proved a big hit with the ladies . Arguably the most popular of all though, other than Wikstr\u00f6m himself, is 36-year-old Hans Linde of Sweden's Left Party, who is as famous for his handsome face as he is for his politics. And while Denmark and Sweden have plenty of good-looking ministers to choose from, the UK has several of its own. Although Sexy MP, a website dedicated to Parliament's great and good-looking, has now shut down, it regularly put Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith, 40, at the top of its looks list while running. MPs snapping at Mr Goldsmith's heels include Labour's shadow education and business secretaries, Tristram Hunt, 40, and Chuka Umunna, 36, . Other politicians to set pulses racing, both past and present, include Barack Obama, French prime minister Manuel Valls and Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. And now, of course, Ed Miliband as well. Smouldering: Mexican president\u00a0Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto has won plaudits for his saturnine good looks .

The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC) made the announcement about Get Rid of Sids Project on Wednesday. The organisation is run by well-known Brisbane anti-vaccination campaigner Stephanie Messenger who has penned a number of children's books, including Melanie's Marvelous Measles. Scroll down for video . Get Rid of Sids, which had been organising events featuring anti-vaccination campaign Sherri Tenpenny, has had its charity status revoked . In a statement, the ACNC said it had revoked Get Rid of Sids Project's charity status after a review into its operations and activities. The decision was effective from April 1 and the organisation had 60 days to lodge an appeal. The ACNC was unable to provide any more details of why this had happened because of 'secrecy provisions' within its Act. This means Get Rid of Sids Project will lose its right to tax concessions and its deductible gift recipient status. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the organisation for comment. Earlier this year, Get Rid of Sids Project ran into controversy when it invited Dr Tenpenny to speak at a number of seminars across Australia. The organisation is headed by prominent Brisbane anti-vaccination campaigner Stephanie Messenger . Her planned trip caused uproar and was repeatedly boycotted by Australian doctors and venues. Following a number of cancellations, Dr Tenpenny made the decision to cancel her remaining talks due to consistent threats of violence from 'anti-free-speech terrorists'. Sherri Tenpenny was due to speak at a number of events in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and the Gold Coast. In a statement posted to social media at the time, she cited a number of reasons why she had decided not to come to Australia, saying a large number of violent threats, including bomb threats, had been made against venue owners and their families. 'The determination was made to protect the speakers, the public and the venue owners as pro-vaccine extremists have made continual, anonymous threats of vandalism and violence,' the statement read. Earlier this year, Get Rid of Sids Project ran into controversy when it invited Dr Tenpenny to speak at a number of seminars across Australia . Dr Tenpenny revealed that she had also cancelled a private holiday in Australia due to concerns for her own personal safety. 'I was coming to speak as an invited guest. However, given the level of hostility that has transpired over the last three weeks, and for the sake of my own personal safety, I have also cancelled my planned vacation in Australia,' she said. Stephanie Messenger, who heads Get Rid of Sids Project and had invited Dr Tenpenny to speak, is the controversial author of\u00a0Melanie's Marvelous Measles. The message of the book, which tells children having the measles is fun, was panned by reviewers on Amazon. Messenger said the aim of her book was to 'educate children on the benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and successfully'. But people on the internet had other ideas about her picture book, with the book receiving 872 ratings of one star. While the reviews sarcastically thanked Messenger for her contribution.",

The two Syrian men, aged 26 and 27, were among the 90 survivors of the tragedy, some of whom were filmed being pulled to safety after clinging to wreckage in rough waters.

Perilous journey: Their parents had gambled everything to seek a new life in Europe and on this occasion they were lucky it didn't end in tragedy . A woman (left) gives milk to her son as she arrives with others migrans at the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . In the wake of the tragedies, Italy has pressed the European Union to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean. Italian defence minister Roberta Pinotti said refugee camps should be set up in countries bordering Libya and human traffickers must be targeted with military intervention. 'We know where the smugglers keep their boats, where they gather,' Ms Pinotti said. 'The plans for military intervention are there.' She was speaking a day before EU leaders hold an emergency summit in Brussels on the crisis. Ms Pinotti said she was cautiously hopeful that the EU summit would take tangible steps to deal with the migrant crisis. Hundreds of migrants have been arriving on Italian shores for days after being rescued at sea when their overloaded boats run into problems. 'We think it's the moment in which Europe decides, forcefully, to have an international police operation, which will undo this band of criminals,' Ms Pinotti said. Rescued migrants walk along the quayside after disembarking from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica in Sicily . Italy has pressed the EU to devise plans to stop the tide of migrants on smuggler boats in the Mediterranean . Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has urged the European Union to craft long-range, comprehensive policy on the migrants. He said one way would be to establish refugee camps in Niger, Sudan and elsewhere in Africa with UN assistance. Italy has saved some 200,000 migrant lives at sea since the start of 2014. But Italy's 'noble, generous reaction alone isn't enough', he said. 'We are asking Europe to be Europe, not just when it's time to devise a budget.' He said broad, long-term EU strategy, with wider sea patrols and a robust presence in southern Libya, would help combat '21st-century slave drivers' of migrants. Ms Pinotti said Italy would be ready to take the helm of any military intervention if asked and as long as it is carried out as an international mission, backed by the United Nations. 'We're ready to do our share. We're the closest country to Libya,' she said. Exodus: Of the 446 people on board the Italian rescue vessel, the navy said 59 of them were children . Displaced: Hundreds of migrants have been arriving on Italian shores for days after being rescued at sea . Growing problem: Italy has saved some 200,000 migrant lives at sea since the start of 2014 . Distressing: A man brings the body of a young migrant ashore after he drowned in a shipwreck off Rhodes . The defence minister said the flow of migrants is not about to stop, saying: '90 per cent are from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, from places where they are afraid of dying. 'We cannot stop them' from leaving their homelands. Mr Renzi and Ms Pinotti indicated that requests for asylum could be processed in refugee camps in African countries near Libya. These could include Tunisia, Niger and Sudan. Italy's defence minister said that it would then be up to all EU countries to take their share of migrants found eligible for refugee status or asylum. Because Italy is the first EU country the migrants set foot in, they stay in reception centres, sometimes for years, while their requests or appeals for asylum are processed. Migrants deemed ineligible for asylum are ordered to be expelled, but many slip away and head to northern Europe to reach relatives.

On April 16, Molly Parks was found in the bathroom of the pizza restaurant where she worked in Manchester, New Hampshire with a needle still in her arm. When police turned up on her father's door in Saco, Maine, he immediately knew they were there about Molly. Days later, he wrote an\u00a0obituary\u00a0announcing her death. 'She made a lot of bad decisions including experimenting with drugs,' it reads. 'She fought her addiction to heroin for at least five years and had experienced a near fatal overdose before. Loss: Molly Parks, 24, passed away on April 16 after she overdosed on heroin in the bathroom of the restaurant where she worked. Her family has written an honest obituary about her struggle with drugs . 'Molly's family truly loved her and tried to be as supportive as possible as she struggled with the heroin epidemic that has been so destructive to individuals and families in her age bracket.' The obituary closes with a plea to other families to help their loved ones if they see they are going through the same struggles. 'If you have any loved one's who are fighting addiction [sic], Molly's family asks that you do everything possible to be supportive, and guide them to rehabilitation before it is too late,' it reads. Her father, Tom Parks, said she had abused alcohol and prescription pills before moving on to heroin. They\u00a0tried numerous ways to get her to stop, from being nice to being mean, but she continued using the drugs, he told\u00a0NPR. Then last August, while staying with her aunt in Manchester, she overdosed and was found passed out in the bathroom, he told\u00a0WMUR. She was rushed to hospital and went to rehab on three separate occasions. Heartbroken: Her father, Tom Parks, said he knew that when police turned up on his doorstep, they were there about Molly. He pleaded with other families to 'stay right on top' of loved ones with addictions . Loved: Tom Parks shared this image showing him with Molly when she was little . Candid: The obituary pleads with families to be supportive and get help for their loved ones with addictions . Despite her struggles, she remained a vivacious personality who loved theater, fashion and reading Harry Potter, according to her obituary. She 'will always be remembered for fearless personality and her trademark red lipstick,' it reads. The weekend before her death, she had visited her father and stepmother in Maine. She was working as a delivery driver for the pizza restaurant and seemed to be doing well, Tom Parks said. But days later, she was found inside the restaurant's bathroom with the needle in her arm. 'Don't believe your addict is clean,' her father told WMUR. 'Don't do it. You have to be diligent. Stay right on top of them.' On Facebook, her sister Kasey also shared her honest thoughts about her sister's passing. Battle: Molly had visited her dad and stepmom just days before she passed away and seemed to be doing well, they said. They remembered her as someone who loved fashion, theater and red lipstick . 'Young people need to realize that they aren't invincible,' she wrote on her Facebook page. 'Please ask yourself this: is this really worth putting my family and friends through this tragedy if I were to pass away, just so that way I can get that one last high. Every drug abuser/user would probably say yes the gamble is worth it. The families would say it's not.' She went on: 'All my family and I want to do is save a restless soul by spreading awareness of this raging epidemic that needs to be a controlled somehow in someway. 'RIP my memories of you will never die, neither will my love for you.'",

Saige, five, who's from the US, concludes the passionate rant by declaring she will move out and stay with her mum's best friend: 'I'm moving on, I'm going to Jenn's!' Unfortunately for her, her mother refuses to take the threat seriously and just laughs at her daughter, responding: 'No you're not.' Scroll down for video .

When her mother - who hasn't revealed her name but posts videos under YouTube channel Fourth St. James - asks her why she has to move out, Saige says she's been in the house 'way too long... for, like, five years'. She tells her mother what's behind her bad mood, explaining: 'I need to move on sometimes'. Saige then adds: 'I will make Jenn's house as clean as I can make it.

A glum-looking Thomas Muller, Manuel Neuer and Pep Guardiola were pictured at the airport ready to board their flight back to Bavaria after their 3-1 loss at the Estadio Dragao on Wednesday. The defeat was the price the five-time European champions paid for a string of injuries and a tired squad that has not stopped playing, chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. Thomas Muller, Xabi Alonso and the rest of the squad get off the bus at the airport before returning to Germany . A glum-looking Pep Guardiola prepares to board the flight in Portugal with his depleted squad . Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and Guardiola make their way on to the plane as they return to Bavaria after defeat . Bayern, chasing a treble of domestic and European titles, travelled with only 15 outfield players to Portugal for their quarter-final first leg leaving injured Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba, among others, behind. 'I am not prepared to criticise the team,' Rummenigge said in post-midnight banquet. 'There are 13 or 14 players who are at the moment healthy and have been playing three times a week.' Bayern have been cruising towards the Bundesliga title with a 10-point advantage as the injuries seem to hardly affect them domestically. Guardiola cannot believe it as he sees his side beaten 3-1 by Porto in the quarter-final first leg on Wednesday . Neuer looks exasperated as the German champions concede their second goal of the game after 10 minutes . 'But there comes a day when you are a little bit tired, when your legs feel heavy and when you lack some of your concentration,' Rummenigge said. A lack of concentration certainly contributed to the three goals they conceded, each coming from an individual defensive mistake. What had been for much of the season their strongest asset - Bayern conceded just four goals in their first 17 Bundesliga games - was on Wednesday their Achilles heel. Jerome Boateng, Xabi Alonso and Dante, all lost possession or control near the box, allowing the Portuguese to score. Colombian Jackson Martinez rounds Neuer with ease before slotting into an empty net to put Porto 3-1 ahead . Bayern boss Pep Guardiola looks perplexed as his side fall two goals behind during the early stages of the Champions League clash . 'We imagined it differently,' said keeper Manuel Neuer, who was lucky not to be sent off after bringing down Jackson Martinez for a third-minute penalty. 'We were not confident and did not create scoring chances. The other problem was the mistakes we made. You are punished in the Champions League for those. We know we messed up together but we have to keep going.' While Bayern are not used to losing, they have every chance to overturn the first leg deficit, with Ribery and possibly Schweinsteiger fit for the return leg in Munich on Tuesday. 'I am not fully dissatisfied with the team,' coach Pep Guardiola said. 'We tried everything but it is not easy against such a physical team. 'It is a complicated result but we will take a shot at it in the return leg and we will not give up that easily.'",

    "source": "The owners of an Indiana pizza shop who refused to cater a gay wedding have gone into hiding - but plan to re-open soon after raising $500,000. Memories Pizza in Walkerton faced criticism this week after co-owner Crystal O'Connor expressed support for a new Indiana religious objections law. Despite 'keeping a low profile' Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor went on Fox News on Thursday to discuss their comments and and the backlash they've received. It was revealed on Thursday that the pizza shop has never catered a wedding before. Scroll down for videos . In hiding: Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor said they'll re-open soon but were forced to close the doors to their pizza shop because the phones kept ringing and they didn't know if orders were fake or real . 'Anger. Bitterness. It's something I never expected or imagined when the comments were made. It's just unimaginable to me,' said Kevin when asked about the reaction to his daughter saying she would deny gay couples pizza on their wedding day. When asked if they'll ever re-open their pizza place Kevin said he initially shut down because he 'couldn't tell if they were getting real orders or fake orders' and said that the phone rang all day and all night. 'We plan to re-open soon we just don't know when,' Crystal said. A contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze set up the fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in'. Controversy: The O'Connors made their comments a week after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed, forbidding state or local government from 'substantially 'burdening' a person's right to their beliefs . up in arms: Demonstrators  gather outside the City County Building on March 30 in Indianapolis to protest the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . A new Indiana law passed yesterday states that no one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The news comes a little after a week  Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics say would allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just a few days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57 on Tuesday, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.\u2019 According to TMZ, O'Connor tried to clarify his views, saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers, but as a Christian he disagrees with gay marriage, and so would refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. The pizza joint has been in operation for nine years. The interior of the old-fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes. Just outside the pizzeria, a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer. 'We are a Christian establishment,' Crystal O\u2019Connor confirmed, but pointed out that their business practices are not biased. Shuttered: Memories Pizza in Indiana, whose owners Crystal and Kevin O'Connor (pictured) said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding, closed its doors after being abused over the phone and online . \u2018We're not discriminating against anyone, that's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything,\u2019 insisted O'Connor. When Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week, the O\u2019Connor family in Walkerton applauded his decision. The measure prohibits state and local government from \u2018substantially burdening\u2019 the ability of people \u2014 including businesses \u2014 to follow their religious beliefs. Pence said in a statement last Thursday that the bill ensures \u2018religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law.\u2019 Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people, but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Several reviewers invoked Adolf Hitler and the KKK in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria but they have since been taken down . Crystal O\u2019Connor, of Memories Pizza, dismissed discrimination concerns, saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs. She added that as a devout Christian, she does not support same-sex marriage \u2013 a conviction shared by her father. He said: \u2018That lifestyle is something they choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head to go along with something they choose?\u2019 The Facebook and Yelp pages for the restaurant about 20 miles southwest of South Bend were bombarded with over 300 mixed reviews and their pizza place has currently just 2.5 stars following the family's controversial statements. A coach of a high school golf program was suspended after a Twitter post he wrote mentioned going to Walkerton and burning down the restaurant. The picture section of the review page has was swamped with images, some of which contain explicit content, supporting homosexuality and gay rights. It appears as though those images have since been taken down. One five-star review, written from the point of view of 'Adolf. H' no longer on the page stated: \u2018Memories Pizza had been recommended to me by my buddy Herman years ago - and his praise was well deserved. \u2018The largely Aryan ownership manages their subhuman staff quite well. No y*** or q****s to speak of and the tomato sauce was pretty decent for canned.\u2019 No longer on yelp: The pizzeria's Yelp page was targeted by those who disagreed with the O'Connors' statements, attracting hundreds of one star reviews, some of which were removed . User Marco V. wrote in his review in part: 'You don't want sinners coming into your business? guess what? We are all sinners.' The review was accompanied by a meme of Crystal O'Connor with a speech bubble that read: 'Jesus said bigotry is great for sales!' Many Yelpers mocked Ms O\u2019Connor\u2019s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception. 'As a pizza loving lesbian - I would NEVER serve pizza at my wedding. Morons,' fumed Laura D from Long Beach, New York. Another critic of the Walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough. \u2018I\u2019m ANGRY and will never order pizza from these people again because they're simply not discriminatory enough! I mean, just \"gays\"? What about anyone who works on Sundays (Leviticus 23:3)? People who wear makeup (Jeremiah 4:30)? Hungry people (Proverbs 23:2)? Men without beards (Leviticus 19:27)? Tattooed people (Leviticus 19:28)? People who eat shellfish (Leviticus 11:10)? People with messy hair (Leviticus 10:6)? New mothers (Leviticus 12:4-5)? Psychics or mediums (Leviticus 20:27)?\u2019 A small number of people have come to the O\u2019Connors' defense amid an avalanche of negative comments. Lori Childers wrote on the eatery\u2019s Facebook page: \u2018God Bless you for standing up for your rights, its YOUR business and you should run it however you see fit. Sick of LBGT denying me of my God given rights. Go find another store to shop at or hey open your own store.......\u2019 Governor Pence addressed the backlash against the bill in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece published Monday, writing that he abhors discrimination. 'If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn\u2019t eat there anymore,' he said.",

    "source": "Ronan Ghosh, 39, stole \u00a3200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco store in Birmingham, court heard . A millionaire company director was caught on CCTV shoplifting \u00a3200 worth of meat and wine from a Tesco supermarket. Ronan Ghosh, 39, was filmed attempting to smuggle the goods out of the store in a bag after paying for other items at the checkout. The company boss heads a global recycling company with a turnover of \u00a316million, lives in a \u00a3500,000 home in an exclusive neighbourhood and runs two BMWs. But a court heard that he was caught shoplifting after heading to a Tesco store following an argument with his girlfriend. His own barrister told the judge the offence \u2018beggars belief\u2019. Ghosh initially elected trial by jury but he then pleaded guilty to theft. Judge Murray Creed imposed a 12-month community order on Ghosh and told him to complete 80 hours\u2019 unpaid work and pay \u00a3575 costs. Birmingham Crown Court heard on Tuesday that Ghosh visited the Tesco store in Stratford Road, south Birmingham, on February 21 and was captured on its security cameras selecting items, including meat and bottles of wine, which he put into a bag. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said he then went to the checkout and paid for shopping that was in his trolley, but not for what was in the bag. Ghosh was detained by a security guard and police were called. In 2009, the businessman set up RG Recycling \u2013 based in Solihull, West Midlands \u2013 after more than a decade working in the plant and recycling industry. Charnjit Jutla, defending, told the court the firm supplies \u2018high-value machinery for the recycling industry\u2019. He added: \u2018It is a global business. It has a yearly turnover of \u00a316million. It beggars belief as to why he finds himself in this court. He accepts full responsibility for what he has done.\u2019 Mr Jutla said Ghosh, who lives in a tree-lined road in Solihull, was \u2018disappointed with himself and shocked and embarrassed\u2019. On the day of the theft, his father had told him his mother had been diagnosed with skin cancer and that had \u2018worried him a lot\u2019. Mr Jutla said there was also a will being discussed within the family which had put considerable strain on him. Ghosh told police he had visited the Tesco store after having an argument with his girlfriend. He claimed he had not intended to steal the goods. Ghosh, who lives in a luxury \u00a3550,000 house in leafy Solihull, initially elected trial by jury at Birmingham Crown Court but then pleaded guilty to theft. He was given a 12-month community order and must pay \u00a3575 in costs . One neighbour of Ghosh said yesterday: \u2018He has two really nice cars \u2013 BMWs. It\u2019s bizarre that he would do something like shoplifting. He seems really nice and pleasant.\u2019 A number of people in the public eye have been accused of shoplifting. In 2012, celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson was cautioned by police after being caught stealing cheese, onions and discounted coleslaw during five shoplifting episodes in 16 days at a Tesco store in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

Experts found the giant U.S. ship - which could incredibly still have a plane inside it - standing upright and listing only slightly. The USS Independence is resting 800m underwater off California's Farallon Islands with its hull and deck very well preserved and clearly visible. There also appears to be a plane in the hangar bay of the vessel, scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Features of the 'amazingly intact' USS Independence are captured in a three-dimensional sonar image (bottom) of the shipwreck - 64 years after it sunk . Historic: Experts found the giant U.S. ship (pictured in 1943) - which could incredibly still have a plane inside it - standing upright and listing only slightly . High tech: Experts last month used an autonomous underwater vehicle called the Echo Ranger (pictured) made by Boeing to survey the Independence . Ambitious: The ranger was deployed as part of a two-year mission by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to find historic shipwrecks . Found: The USS Independence was found off California's Farallon Islands (pictured) with its hull and deck very well preserved and clearly visible . The veteran ship even survived an atomic bomb test after being chosen as a 'target vessel' for Operation Crossroads on July 1, 1946. After taking part in yet another explosion, it was eventually decommissioned in August 1946 before its highly radioactive hull was taken to San Francisco five years later. Controversy surrounds its sinking as some believe the ship was loaded with barrels of radioactive waste that subsequently contaminated the wildlife in the Farallon Islands. 'After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,' said James Delgado chief scientist on the NOAA mission. He added: 'This ship fought a long, hard war in the Pacific and after the war was subjected to two atomic blasts that ripped through the ship. 'It is a reminder of the industrial might and skill of the \"greatest generation\" that sent not only this ship but their loved ones to war.' The carrier is one of an estimated 300 wrecks in the waters off San Francisco - and the deepest known shipwreck in the sanctuary, according to NOAA. Independence operated in the central and western Pacific from November 1943 to August 1945 and later was one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for atomic bomb tests in 1946 in the Marshall Islands. Mystery: Controversy surrounds Independence's sinking as some believe the ship was loaded with barrels of radioactive waste that subsequently contaminated the wildlife in the Farallon Islands .

'Greatest generation': 'After 64 years on the seafloor, Independence (pictured in 1943) sits on the bottom as if ready to launch its planes,' said James Delgado chief scientist on the NOAA mission . Veteran: Independence (pictured in 1946) was one of more than 90 vessels assembled as a target fleet for atomic bomb tests in 1946 . Damaged by shock waves, heat and radiation, Independence survived the tests and returned to the United States. It was moored in San Francisco until age caught up with her and she was towed out to sea for scuttling in January 1951. Independence was found as part of a two-year NOAA mission to locate historic shipwrecks in the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary and nearby waters. Experts last month used an autonomous underwater vehicle called the Echo Ranger made by Boeing to survey the Independence. There are currently no plans at the moment to try and get inside the vessel, Delgado said. Independence was built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation and commissioned in January 1943. She took part in the attacks on Rabaul and Tarawa in Japan before being torpedoed by Japanese planes, having to be repaired and refitted in San Francisco from January to July 1944.",

    "source": "West of Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)The call from Faleh Essawi, the deputy chief of the provincial council, who we were supposed to be meeting up with, came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from Baghdad to neighboring Anbar province. \"ISIS has taken the east of the city, it's not accessible,\" he says, sounding frantic, rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas ISIS fighters had just stormed into. Moments later, we see the impact: An endless stream of humanity, shell shocked, and exhausted. Parents cradle babies in blankets, some struggle under the weight of their belongings, some carry small plastic bags, while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands. Cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the Euphrates. The government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into Iraq's capital. Those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men, normally used to carry produce to markets. An elderly woman sits in one, a child in her arms, a worn down plastic doll in her hand. Many don't want to talk, at least not for long. What they just went through is too raw, too painful. One man we encounter describes how ISIS fighters commandeered his house. \"We heard clashes in the early morning, and we couldn't see the security forces anywhere,\" he recalls. \"We saw the ISIS fighters, they just came into the house, they didn't say a word. They just sent a sniper to the roof.  I grabbed my children and ran.\" His wife bursts into tears, prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going. Another older woman, sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren, starts sobbing the moment we approach her. \"They took our homes and kicked us out,\" she cries. Over the weekend ISIS moved into towns just to the north of Ramadi, which lies 68 miles (110km) west of Baghdad, sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city.  ISIS had already blocked off access from the south months ago, and the west was contested territory.  The east, until now, was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit. At a hospital in Amriyat al-Falluja, about a 15-minute drive away, a wounded local fighter winces in pain. He was shot by a sniper in Ramadi that morning as ISIS fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart. \"We had been warning we could see their movements,\" he tells us. \"But we just didn't have the force to hold them off.  We didn't leave a single person we didn't call and ask for back up.\" But none came. Hours after our morning conversation we speak to Essawi again by phone. \"Security is collapsing in the city,\" he screams. \"This is what we warned Baghdad would happen. Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi? \"Just God knows if we will survive this,\" he says and hangs up. Amriyat al-Falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from ISIS positions nearby. The hospital's fa\u00e7ade is scarred by shrapnel. The wards are full of people injured during these attacks. Fifteen-year-old Mustafa Ahmed has bandages on his neck, leg, and other parts of his body. \"A mortar fell on our street, one of my neighbors was wounded,\" he explains. \"We went out to help him and the second one fell on us.\" His friend died, he says. In the next room Amal Ahmed speaks softly. \"I was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open,\" she says, as tears roll down her face. \"Something fell out of me and I grabbed it and I put it back in and I lay down.\" She starts to cry harder. Her husband was killed by U.S. forces in Fallujah -- another city in Anbar -- in 2003.  Her children have all moved away except her youngest, who broke his arm in the same attack. \"When I see the situation I don't have hope, it's just getting worse.\" A few moments later, we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital's buildings. They think it's an ISIS rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the Iraqi forces we are with in the hallway, away from the windows. More explosions go off in the distance. Then another actually shakes our building. \"Anyone want tea?\" one of the policemen with us asks, laughing as he pours.  \"This happens all the time, we're used to it.\" The police chief, Major Aref al-Janabi, radios to his men to respond.  Al-Janabi, like so many others, is frustrated with the lack of support from Baghdad.  Earlier, he had taken us to the front lines, a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions.  He says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for ISIS positions, but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements. More explosions follow in the distance. We're quickly moved out and leave the town, heading back towards the bridge and the long, snaking lines of refugees. An ambulance passes us, trying to force its way through the crowds.  The swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given Essawi's dire assessment and warning. \"Ramadi is under siege from all sides,\" he'd told us earlier, anger mixed with an air of resignation. \"I consider the city to have fallen.\" He claimed that 150,000 have fled, scoffing at statements from Iraqi officials in Baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to Ramadi.  He has yet to see them.",

He has experienced a great escape at the Hawthorns before, in 2005 as assistant to Bryan Robson.

Leicester secured their second consecutive Premier League win to bring safety into view for the first time in a long time. Pearson\u2019s side are still bottom, but now just three points behind Hull in 17th. With seven games to go, five at home, they are still very much in this fight.

In the first minute of added time he bullied Gareth McAuley to gain possession by the halfway line and advanced on goal. Joleon Lescott was unable to halt him and in a flash the ball was in the net. Pearson turned to his bench and held both arms aloft. He had switched to three at the back at the interval and made all his substitutions with half an hour to go, and been vindicated. Trailing 2-1, Leicester had equalised in the 80th minute when Marc Albrighton delivered a cross that reached David Nugent at the far post. He hooked the ball back, Marcin Wasilewski won the header and Robert Huth nodded beyond Craig Dawson on the line.

West Brom looked resplendent in their replica kits from that year, numbered one to 11. Darren Fletcher paid a fitting tribute with a very good glancing header to Chris Brunt\u2019s corner. Goal-line technology was required to confirm the goal after Esteban Cambiasso cleared. It was Fletcher\u2019s first goal since scoring for Manchester United in November 2012. Leicester equalised in the 20th minute. Cambiasso took a long free-kick that Leonardo Ulloa flicked forward for Nugent to stroke in a composed finish. West Brom went ahead again six minutes later when Craig Gardner\u2019s volley deflected off Wes Morgan into the net. But Leicester struck back impressively and, from nowhere, have genuine hope of survival. \u2018You never want to come off the field with regrets,\u2019 said Pearson. \u2018If we can maximise that home advantage we have a chance.

    "source": "Prince George's birth in 2013 sparked a \u00a3247m sales bonanza for makers of royal memorabilia but experts say the second royal baby is unlikely to have the same effect. A more modest sales increase of between \u00a360 and \u00a370m is predicted, with most of that spent on champagne and cake rather than royal souvenirs. However, the baby is expected to make more of an impact in the long term - especially if the child turns out to be a girl. Scroll down for video . Smaller scale: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child will have a lesser effect at the tills . 'It\u2019s not so much of a major event when you have another baby,' explains\u00a0Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research. 'I think it will have an impact on the sales of prosecco and champagne and cake but not much more than that.' Despite his warning, scores of companies are hoping to cash in on the second royal birth, with plans for items ranging from mugs to beauty boxes afoot. Leading the charge to the tills is the Royal Mint which announced plans for a commemorative \u00a35 coin last week, and the Royal Collection Trust. Potter Emma Bridgewater has designed a special mug, while beauty subscription company BirchBox is offering a 'royally good' box containing Korres showergel and Lola Barcelona nailpolish among other items. Bonanza: The birth of Prince George sparked a \u00a3247m sales boom between the 1st July and 31st August 13 . Prince of Sales: Since then, George has gone on to replicate his mother's impact on clothing sales . The new baby's grandfather Prince Charles is also hoping for a baby-related boost to his charity coffers via products sold in his Highgrove shop. Although no official memorabilia is planned, The Highgrove Shop, which turns over its profits to the Prince of Wales\u2019s Charitable Foundation, already sells organic baby balm for \u00a324.95, a Highgrove baby bear for \u00a334.95 and a \u201chappy and glorious\u201d baby blanket, featuring guards in red tunics and bearskin hats, priced at \u00a394.95. The flurry of royal baby memorabilia echoes that sparked by the birth of Prince George, when the market was flooded by everything from bibs to books. Other items included royal-themed potties, dummies featuring crowns, bibs proclaiming 'I love Aunty Pippa' and a book entitled Shhh! Don\u2019t Wake The Royal Baby! While there's no shortage of choice this time around, Professor Bamfield says the baby's long-term impact on retail will be more significant than the initial flurry. 'When the baby has a certain sweater on, everybody will want to buy that,' he says, pointing to the ongoing Kate and George effects. Making his mark: Outfits worn by Prince George such as these Rachel Riley dungarees, sell out . New baby, new coin: The Royal Mint is producing a series of coins to mark the new royal birth . 'The impact of the baby is going to be over a longer period, particularly if it\u2019s a girl. [It will be about] the equipment they use, her clothes, her toys.' Items that will be available in the short term include an as yet unseen collection of commemorative china from the Royal Collection Trust. The designs will not be unveiled until after the birth and confirmation of the baby\u2019s sex and production is not likely to be completed until after the baby has been named. For George in July 2013, the Royal Collection produced items including a pillbox (\u00a330), a small loving cup (\u00a339), a dessert plate (\u00a345) and a limited-edition loving cup (\u00a3195). More commemorative mugs will come from the Staffordshire potteries, who, along with Emma Bridgewater, traditionally mark royal events. The Royal Mint is also to produce a celebratory \u00a35 coin - again repeating the routine after Prince George's birth when it produced 10,000 silver crown-sized \u00a35 coins. Each one cost \u00a380 while a further 2,013 22-carat gold sovereigns, all featuring St. George, were sold for \u00a3800 apiece.",

    "source": "Two men who became locked inside an airtight bank vault for six hours had to be dramatically rescued by firefighters using heavy drills. Jacob Church, 21, and Joe Tobin, 29, were at an art exhibition at a former bank building when the vault door shut behind them, leaving them trapped in total darkness. The pair - who had only met earlier that night - were fed water through a tube to prevent them becoming dehydrated while police kept in contact with them to check their oxygen levels were not getting dangerously low. After their six-hour ordeal, eventually fire crews with specialist drills were able to cut through the thick concrete walls. Trapped: Joe Tobin (left) and Jacob Church (right) pose for a selfie after getting trapped in the vault . Locked in: The pair - who only met earlier in the night - were shut inside the vault for almost six hours . Exhibition: The duo had attended the launch of the exhibition at the Abacus art space in Cardiff's Wood Street . Mr Church, who is from Taff's Well, has described the incident at the launch night of an exhibition at the Abacus art space in Cardiff's Wood Street as 'pretty nuts'. It was hosting the opening of the Look No Hands exhibition described by its curators as 'an eyeball massacre and a massage of visionary art.' One of the exhibition rooms was the 6m x 6m old bank vault with its thick metal door held ajar. The 21-year-old - who admits he was a 'little drunk' - went into the vault with fellow art enthusiast Mr Tobin at 1am. When he tried to close the door slightly, it shut fully and inadvertently activated the lock. He said: 'We were just in there and realised there was a really nice echo in the room. I went to shut the door a tiny bit and it shut the whole way. 'At first we sort of laughed, but when we phoned out friends to come and let us out they couldn't. 'After about 20 minutes of hearing banging on the door we realised no one could get us out. You would think someone would have the code for the door.' Rescue mission: Fire crews had to save the pair and this meant the exhibition was shut on Saturday . Light: The emergency crews managed to drill through the wall and pass the pair glow sticks and ear plugs . Although the two art enthusiasts could hear noise outside, they were unaware what was going on, but were told the fire service had been called. The first crews arrived at 1.48am and initially tried to unlock the door. But when that didn't work, they had to drill through the wall to create a hole large enough for the two men to escape. 'They tried drilling for two hours but then had to call for back-up and then more back-up,' Mr Church said. Part of Havelock Street, in Cardiff, was closed for the emergency services to access the building. The initial amusement and novelty of the situation quickly wore off, said Mr Church. 'We started off with fairly high hopes. The first few hours we were singing and running around the room and trying to make the best of it. 'After two or three hours, before there was an air hole, we started to think \"Are we going to get out of here?\"'. At that point, two fire engines and a specialist urban search and rescue team arrived and use drilling equipment to penetrate the thick concrete walls. The emergency crews drilled a small hole through the vault door to speak to the pair and passed them glow sticks for light and ear plugs. They then handed them a plastic tube through a hole to enable them to drink water. Strangers: Jacob Church (left) and Joe Tobin (right) were locked in the vault in total darkness for six hours . Mr Church, a former lab technician at Specsavers, added: 'We got a phone call about every half an hour from a police woman who kept asking us if our oxygen levels were OK. 'It was worrying but I told them if it does run out what can they do for us anyway?' The fire crews drilled around 15 inch-wide holes into the thick wall, which was reinforced with metal bars. They eventually created a big enough hole for the two men to crawl out unharmed at 6.45am. Exhibition curator Ariell Tye, 31, said they always kept the vault door open for 'health and safety reasons'. She said: 'Some people were messing around and have physically closed the door themselves which is pretty difficult in itself. 'They have turned the wheel lock door mechanism and couldn't get back out. We were informed immediately and phoned the emergency services straight away. 'When the two men came out they were in good spirits and were unharmed.' Ms Tye said the artists took over the former bank last June for no rent because the building will be demolished in two years to make way for the new BBC Wales headquarters. She said there was no chance of a repeat incident because the vault door was now permanently locked. A South Wales Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: 'It's an unusual one by any stretch of the imagination. 'We received a call to a premises at 1.48am. Two male persons were rescued from an internal bank vault. 'There was a limited air supply in the nature of it being a bank vault and our urban search and rescue team were called in with specialist equipment. 'There were no injuries. We were assisted by paramedics and police were also in attendance.' The gallery was closed on Saturday, but will reopen as normal on Wednesday.",

The men - two 21-year-olds and a 25 and 22-year-old - collapsed on the vessel on Good Friday, forcing it to dock near the Opera House. They were rushed to St Vincent's Hospital. Police said heir condition was critical overnight but they are now stable. On Friday afternoon, about 800 partygoers poured off the Bella Vista boat after the party came to an end . Four men are believed to have suffered from drug overdoses during a party cruise on Sydney Harbour, possibly due to a dangerous strain of ecstasy pills known as 'blue scissors' One man is suspected of taking up to four ecstasy pills in one hit, including blue ones with scissor stamps on them, a friend told police. Police believe at least that man, and possibly the others, had taken 'blue scissor' pills, similar to those linked to overdoses in Cronulla last year. Three men and a woman were hospitalised last November after taking the pills. On Friday afternoon, about 800 partygoers poured off the Bella Vista boat after the party came to an end. Police allege an officer was assaulted as people left the vessel.\u00a0Two men, 21 and 22, were charged and will appear in court this month. Before the boat - which was hosting a 'Dirty Funken Beats' party - left King Street Wharf at noon, three sniffer dogs were on hand to greet passengers . Police say they discovered cocaine, marijuana and MDMA before the boat left the wharf . Before the boat - which was hosting a 'Dirty Funken Beats' party - left King Street Wharf at noon, three sniffer dogs were on hand to greet passengers. 'We are rather concerned about how the drugs came on board,' Acting Superintendent Joe McNulty said. 'Instead of getting one drug dog yesterday, we went pretty firm and got three drug detection dogs there to comb the wharf, comb the area and all the participants before they boarded the boat.' Police discovered cocaine, marijuana and MDMA, Supt McNulty said. Disgruntled passengers took to Facebook on Saturday demanding refunds from promoters. 'How bout that refund eh?' one person wrote. Dirty Funken Beats responded: 'We work hard to put on awesome parties for everyone and something happens out of our control and you want 40 bucks back. 'Not overly thoughtful but we will sort it for you.' The cruise operator was served with a short-term closure order, preventing the vessel going back on the water for 72 hours. Supt McNulty said it was the first time such an order had been served on a Sydney Harbour party boat. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

    "source": "'Loneliness maps' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas' residents are most at risk. Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.",

Jon \"Bones\" Jones, the reigning UFC light heavyweight champion, is wanted for \"his possible involvement in a hit-and-run accident\" Sunday morning, Albuquerque police said. A pregnant woman in her 20s who was driving another vehicle suffered minor injuries in the accident, police said. \"Officers attempted to contact Mr. Jones at his residence Sunday evening, but were unsuccessful,\" Albuquerque police said in a statement. \"We have also reached out to his lawyer, but as of now, have not heard back.\" Police stressed that they cannot confirm whether Jones was involved in the crash.

But he has also had his struggles. In January, Jones entered a drug rehabilitation center after testing positive for cocaine in a test administered by the Nevada Athletic Commission. He checked himself out of rehab after one day of treatment. Jones is scheduled to fight Anthony Johnson in UFC 187 on May 23 in Las Vegas.",

    "source": "(CNN)Americans on the United States' no-fly list will now be privy to information about why they have been banned from commercial flights and be given the opportunity to dispute their status, according to court documents filed by the Justice Department this week. The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. The decision was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the ACLU isn't satisfied with the government's new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). \"After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List,\" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we've found that the government's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again.\" People on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government's figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans. Before the change, American citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list. Now, they'll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress, with an option to request further information. \"The U.S. government is making enhancements to the Department of Homeland Security Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to provide additional transparency and process for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the No Fly List,\" the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. In cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status, the government will provide a second, more detailed response, identifying \"specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the No Fly List,\" according to the court documents. An unclassified summary of that information will be provided \"to the extent feasible, consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake,\" court papers said. Those who appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing, with supporting materials or exhibits, and will receive a final written decision from the Transportation Security Administration. The 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge.",

Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.",

In two years the Thames Bath Lido, which will sit near Blackfriars Bridge, should open with the backing of a recently launched crowdfunding project. The plans have moved far quicker than an initial ten-year initiative to clean up the Thames for swimmers with the aid of celebrities such as artist Tracy Emin and David Walliams. In two years the Thames Bath Lido, which will sit near Blackfriars Bridge, should open with the backing of a recently launched crowdfunding project . Floated in 2013 the original idea was conceived by three Londoners who dreamt of bringing the beautiful lakes of Zurich to the capital . James Lowe (left), Chris Romer-Lee (centre) and Matt Bamford-Bowes (right) originally thought up the Thames Lido . Walliams has said if the water is clean enough he will be the first to jump in. The Little Britain star has been a vocal champion of open-water swimming since he crossed the English Channel unaided for charity in 2006. He also did a\u00a0140-mile charity swim of the Thames in 2011. Tracy Emin said she couldn't believe how underused the Thames is adding 'If you could swim in the Thames, it'd be incredible' Professional bodies such as the Royal Academy of Arts, New London Architecture and many others have also pledged their support for the scheme. The plan is to incorporate two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool. The baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around. Founder of the Kickstarter campaign to launch the lido, Chris Romer-Lee said  'Ever since we first sketched out the original concept for Thames Baths, we have always wanted to build something that benefited the community and allowed them to participate in its creation. 'The latter is one of the reasons why we are launching crowdfunding on Kickstarter. We want Londoners, swimmers and anyone passionate about urban waterways to show their support for this project and what better way than a very public campaign.' David Walliams, here pictured swimming the Thames in 2011, has said he will be the first to jump in the new pool . The plan is to incorporate two pools, a 25 meter lap pool and a training pool. The baths will also be heated to make them available for use all year around . The two year plan will include a sophisticated filtration system that would turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido . Floated in 2013 the original idea was conceived by three Londoners who dreamt of bringing the beautiful lakes of Zurich to the capital. The original plan was to create a lido that wasn't just for swimmers, but one that would benefit the local community while also creating a haven for wildlife. The two year plan will include a sophisticated filtration system that would turn the fuel drenched Thames into crystal clear water for anyone swimming in the lido. The local community is set to be a part of the vision of the project too. The facility will be run as a social enterprise rather than a company dictated by profit. A public space created for the people that use it. Thames Baths, the Community Interest Company behind the scheme, is hoping to promote the use of the new Lido to local schools and the elderly. The crowdfunding scheme is hoping to raise a total of \u00a3125,000 within 30 days and a donation of \u00a350 will entitle members to 12 swims. Pledging \u00a35,000 will give investors a year's access to the lido and an opportunity to overview the development project. To donate to the Thames Bath Lido, click here.

The Maticevski show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia on Tuesday went above and beyond to impress guests, with front row attendees given a personalised tablet. But a few of the highly-prized gifts went missing when someone with sticky fingers - perhaps a disgruntled second row guest - decided to snap them up for themselves. Scroll down for video . Sticky fingers: Singer Jessica Mauboy was among the front row attendees at the Maticevski show at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia who had her gifted tablet stolen from her seat . We cleaned up!

Jessica Mauboy, model Maddison Brow, and GQ editor Nick Smith were among those who had their Lenovo tablets stolen from their seats. It should be easy to spot the culprits though, as each of the tablets had been customised with wallpaper bearing their name. Celebrities including Lindy Klim, and Jordan and Zac Stenmark were pictured fawning over their personalised Lenovo tablets before the show started.

Perks of the job: Fashion editors including Elle editor Justine Cullen were among the lucky recipients, and were quick to share their haul on social media . Show organisers had a few back-ups of the $899 tablet on hand that were not customised to give to the theft victims. Despite the drama, the show was a spectacular success, with an A-list turn-out and dazzling creations gracing the catwalk. Toni Maticevski, whose designs are beloved by Jennifer Hawkins, Abbie Cornish and Jess Hart, presented a glimmering display complete with gold, glitter, mesh and tulle.

A Saudi prince has promised to give a free Bentley to every pilot involved in the Yemen air strikes, as bombing raids in the country appeared to resume despite a pledge that they would stop. Saudi Arabian forces launched air strikes on Yemen a month ago to stop advances from the Shiite Houthi rebels, who are allied with Iran and previously overthrew the Saudi-backed government. Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, the Saudi King Abdullah's nephew, has reportedly promised to give each of the 100 fighter pilots involved in the month long raids in Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, a free Bentley. Prince Talal, who owns $300 million stake in Twitter, apparently made the pledge on social media but the post has since been deleted, the International Business Times\u00a0reported. He wrote: 'To recognise the one hundred participating Saudi pilots I am pleased to present them with 100 Bentley cars,' On Tuesday the Saudis said the bombing raids, which have killed at least 944 people and wounded around 3,480, had been successful and they were to focus on finding a political solution instead. But the raids appeared to have resumed by Wednesday, with fighting taking place in Taez. Dozens more people are said to have been wounded or killed. Bin Talal, 60, is the grandson of Saudi Arabia's founder Ibn Saud and one of the richest men ion the world. He has an estimated fortune of $23 billion and investments in London's Savoy Hotel, Apple, Citigroup and News Corp. He has previously gifted 25 Bentleys to members of a Saudi football team and in 2013 threatened to boycott Forbes magazine for underestimating his wealth and saying he was only in 26th place in a list of the world's richest. Almost 1,000 people are thought to have been killed during four weeks of air strikes by Saudi Arabian forces . The Prince, who is a billionaire, has pledged to give each of the pilots involved in the air strikes a Bentley . His comments were met with criticism on Twitter, as well as supporters of those in Yemen who have been killed in the month long airstrikes. Saudi forces began its military campaign, called Operation Decisive Storm, on March 26. They were launched to stop the advancement of Shiite Houthi rebels who had previously overthrown the Saudi-backed government and ousted\u00a0President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. Saudi Arabian forces pledged that air strikes which destroyed areas of Sanaa would stop on Tuesday, but they appeared to resume again on Wednesday following advances by rebels on the ground in Yemen . After four weeks Hadi had still not be reinstated and the rebels still retain control of the capital Sanai. The Saudis announced yesterday an end to the 'successful' Operation Decisive Storm and that they would be moving to a new operation, dubbed 'Restoring Hope.' This is to focus on security and counter terrorism and was said to involve a downscaling of military activity. However the Saudi-led coalition had warned it stood ready to counter against any advance by the rebels - and appeared to take action today as fighting resumed in the second city of Aden as well as Taez. In Taez, the rebels took advantage of the lull in air strikes to overrun the headquarters of the 35th Armoured Brigade, loyal to Hadi,  an army officer said. The conflict has created severe shortages of food and other supplies by closing sea and airports.",

Kim Roberts admitted to stealing the precious paintings, vases and silverware from Dowager Countess Bathurst\u2019s Cirencester mansion and her London home. The 58-year-old worked for the countess, 87, and helped herself to the riches, which included a sketch by Picasso and pewter plates, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Roberts\u2019 haul was said to be worth a total of \u00a3500,000 at an earlier hearing. Kim Roberts (left) admitted stealing antiques and paintings from her employer, the Countess of Bathurst (right) The Bathurst family home, Cirencester Park, houses artistic treasures stretching back more than three centuries to the first Earl Bathurst, who was a patron of art and literature and a friend of authors including Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. Among the estate\u2019s collection are portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, Peter Lely, and Joshua Reynolds. The 3,000 acre grounds are also home to Cirencester Park Polo Club. Prince Charles has regularly played there over the years and his sons William and Harry have followed in his footsteps. Roberts, of Colyton, Devon, yesterday admitted three charges she had previously denied \u2013 including burgling the countess\u2019s Kensington home in Lennox Gardens, where the average asking price is more than \u00a34million. Roberts was working at Cirencester Park, the aristocratic country pile of the Bathursts, in the Cotswolds . Roberts admitted stealing antique vases between May and August in 2013 and stealing a 4x4 Volvo XC90 \u2013 worth at least \u00a345,000 \u2013 from her previous employer interior designer Emily Olympitis in October 2012. She also admitted fraud after dishonestly telling a domestic household staff recruitment agency that she was born in 1958. At a hearing last year, Roberts admitted stealing art and antiques belonging to the countess between April and May 2013. But she had claimed she was guilty only because the property was put in her car by mistake. Yesterday her barrister Simon Burns said she had now abandoned that claim and fully accepted her responsibility. Roberts was told to prepare for a stretch in prison after she admitted stealing antiques and paintings from the Countess of Bathurst . Her victim \u2013 Gloria, the Dowager Countess of Bathurst \u2013 is the widow of the eighth Earl Bathurst, Henry, who died in 2011 aged 84. Their son Allen, formerly Lord Apsley, is now the 9th Earl and lives in the Cirencester Park mansion house with his wife Sara. The Bathursts are one of England\u2019s oldest families, originating from Sussex where they owned Bathurst Castle until they were dispossessed of their lands by Edward IV in 1463, after siding with the Lancastrians in the War of the Roses. Roberts did deny three charges yesterday, including stealing antique silver hairbrushes from Lady Juliet Worsley, and another theft of items including a television and a DVD player. She also denied possession of stolen property including a Mont Blanc pen, items of clothing and several accessories. The Crown Prosecution Service has until today to accept her pleas and allow the charges she denies to rest. Roberts\u2019 lawyer told the court he had spoken to the prosecution and believed her guilty pleas would be accepted and that the other charges would not be proceeded with. Judge Jamie Tabor QC gave the prosecution 24 hours to dispute this and released Roberts on bail until May 7 so a pre-sentence report can be prepared by the probation service. And he told Roberts to expect a prison sentence, saying: \u2018I don\u2019t want you to be under any illusions about the sentence you will receive. You should make arrangements prior to that date on the basis that you are going to be away for some time.\u2019 Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

    "source": "'Double wife killer' Harold Henthorn wants to use a $1.5million life insurance pay out from a policy taken out on his second wife to pay for the defense in his trial for her murder. Henthorn was charged with the murder of second wife, Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have since reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife some 20 years earlier. Both women died in 'freak accidents' to which Henthorn, 59, was the sole witness. Dr Toni Jill Bertolet plunged 140 ft to her death shortly before their 12th wedding anniversary while hiking with Henthorn in a remote stretch of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. First wife, Lynn Rishell, was crushed to death under Henthorn's jeep when, according to Henthorn, the jack gave way as she reached beneath the vehicle for a lug nut while changing a flat tire at night on an isolated highway near the couple's Colorado home. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Henthorn was charged with the murder of Toni Bertolet, 51, last November and police have reopened their investigation into the suspicious death of his first wife, Lynn Rishell, some 20 years earlier . Lynn Rishell - Henthorn's first wife - was crushed to death under the front of Henthorn's Jeep when, he told first responders, the jack gave way as she reached under the vehicle for a lug night while changing a flat tire in the dark . In both cases Henthorn was the sole beneficiary of the women's substantial life insurance policies totalling $500,000 in the case of his first wife and $4.5million in the case of his second. Now, newly filed documents have revealed that he is fighting for a $1.5million pay out from the policy taken out in July 2001 on the grounds that he needs the money to pay for his attorney for the forthcoming murder trial scheduled to begin next month. The documents, filed yesterday and seen by Daily Mail Online, are part of a bitter civil case being fought in Douglas County .They note that, just weeks before he is due to stand trial, Henthorn is 'focused solely on his own desire to have the insurance proceeds disbursed to himself without any meaningful process.' They go onto state: 'Should Henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter, those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this District.' They point out: 'The Colorado Supreme Court has said: \"Killers cannot receive life insurance proceeds from their victims\" and insurers cannot disburse proceeds \"prematurely\", \u2026.when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending.' The next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with Dr Bertolet, Hayley. Dr Bertolet died on 29 September, 2012. The autopsy report, dated 18 December 2012, stated that she 'died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking.' It concluded, 'homicide cannot be excluded.' But when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later, on September 27, 2013 he gave her cause of death as 'Accidental Fall.' At the time Henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an FBI investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower's life, culminating in his arrest last November. But despite facing murder charges Henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife's death. Shockingly, not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense, documents filed in a separate motion in March show that he fought his late wife's family to have funds from Dr Bertolet's estate released into his possession. Last February the District Court of Douglas County, Colorado found in Dr Bertolet's family's favor and barred Henthorn from accessing his late wife's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an 'imminent risk of substantial harm..to [its] financial interests.' Both \u2018freak accidents\u2019 occurred at remote locations with Henthorn the lone witness. Both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and Henthorn, pictured here with his first wife, Rishell, told wildly varying stories about both deaths. Henthorn and Lynn Rishell when he was a new geology graduate from Virginia. The couple moved to Colorado, where after 12 years of marriage, she died in a 'freak accident', now said to be murder . Henthorn (left), pictured with Grace (center) and Lynn (right) Rishell,\u00a0was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $500,000 on the death of his first wife and $4.5million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident . Henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as December and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife's estate. In March Daily Mail Online revealed that, in 2009 Henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law, Grace Rishell. Grace was going through a divorce and 'concerned for her financial stability,' when she initially agreed to Henthorn's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $50,000 to Grace's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $250,000. According to prosecutors in Dr Bertolet's murder case, 'the evidence will show that Henthorn had a romantic interest in Rishell.' But she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through. Instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer. Yet unbeknownst to her, 'her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well,' with Henthorn making payments on the policy until December 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary. The policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that Henthorn had no insurable interest in RIshell. But the very fact of its existence raises the specter that Henthorn had Rishell in his sights as a third potential victim. Henthorn was denied bail by US District Attorney Judge Kathleen Latoyfa who described him as a 'danger' and said, 'there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second.' She pointed to large sums of money recently transferred by Henthorn to his brother as suggestive that he was 'hiding funds.' Henthorn's trial is scheduled to begin in September. He has entered a plea of not guilty.",

Reverend Creflo Dollar, 53, launched an appeal last month for\u00a0200,000 people to each donate '$300 or more' so that he could purchase a\u00a0Gulfstream G650 to replace his current damaged aircraft. The wealthy televangelist, who is known to own two Rolls Royces and multi-million dollar homes, came under heavy criticism for the appeal but has insisted he needs the plane for preaching work. Scroll down for video . Defends private jet appeal: Reverend Creflo\u00a0Dollar has defended trying to buy a $65million Gulfstream G650 with worshippers' donations by claiming 'the devil is trying to discredit' him . The appeal:\u00a0This notice was posted on the church's website, pleading for donations so that Dollar could 'continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ'. It has since been taken down . Dollar, who is one of the most prominent African-American preachers in the United States, launched the private jet appeal via a five-minute video on his website. Shortly afterwards, he shut the website down but worshippers could still donate to the cause via the World Changers donation site\u00a0which remains open. In a newly posted five-minute clip on YouTube, the Atlanta-based pastor responded to his critics saying: '(The devil thinks) I got to discredit that man before he starts showing people Jesus! 'I'm on my sabbatical, and the enemy's trying to discredit me.\u00a0I never one time came to you and asked you for a dime for this airplane, did I? Damaged: Dollar says the church's current plane, bought in 1999, is broken and needs to be replaced, or he will be unable to continue working around the world . 'The (critics) don't know what we do. That's why they asked the question, what does a preacher need with an airplane? If you knew what we did, then you wouldn't ask that question. 'Just because the world doesn't have it, doesn't mean that you can't.' Dollar is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches. His original appeal for the Gulfstream G650 - which claims to be the fastest plane ever built in civilian aviation - was so that 'World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace'. A Gulfstream G650 can fly 18 passengers and four crew members, according to gulfstream.com. The jet comes with two Rolls-Royce engines, high-speed Internet and two multichannel satellites and allows for a four-and-a-half-hour commute from New York to Los Angeles. 'The G650 is the biggest, fastest, most luxurious, longest range and most technologically advanced jet -- by far,' according to the site. Among the billionaires who own a Gulfstream G650 are Steve Jobs' wife Lauren Powell Jobs, Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn add Nike co-founder Phil Knight. There is a long waiting list for the aircraft, with the next round of planes not due until 2017. Couple: Dollar and his wife, Taffi (pictured together) were married in 1985 and have five children . Wealthy: Dollar and his family primarily live in this multi-million dollar in Fayettville, Georgia, south of Atlanta . According to the Creflo Dollar Ministry's website: 'The ministry's current airplane, was built in 1984, purchased by the ministry in 1999 and has since logged four million miles. 'Recently on an overseas trip to a global conference, one of the engines failed. 'By the grace of God, the expert pilot, who's flown with Creflo for almost 20 years, landed the plane safely without injury or harm to any passengers.' The Christian Post first reported that Dollar insisted that he needs the jet to continue sharing the word of Jesus. He preaches all over the world, but primarily works out of a 8,500-seat amphitheater in Atlanta called the 'World Dome', sending the sermons to churches all over the country via satellite. The website pledge continued: 'Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness.' Arrested: The Reverend was charged in 2012 for allegedly attacking his teenage daughter . 'Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! 'We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ,\" the appeal continued before asking supporters of the ministry to sow a $300 seed into the airplane fund, billed Project G650.' According to Financial Juneteenth, a\u00a0Report of the Senate Finance Committee, Minority Staff Review of WCCI, found that Dollar's current jet had also been used for a variety of vacation flights, including stops in Las Vegas, Nevada, Miami, Florida and Hawaii, citing Federal Aviation Administration figures. Dollar has refused over the years to disclose his salary, but has an estimated net worth of $27 million. He has five children to his wife, Taffi, who he married in 1985. In June 2012, his 15-year-old daughter called 911, saying her father repeatedly punched and choked her at their Atlanta home. The teenager also said it wasn't the first time something like that had happened and that she felt threatened living in the house. Dollar was arrested and charged with family brutality and juvenile cruelty. The charges were later dropped, but he was required to complete a three-month anger management program. At his next sermon, two days following the arrest, Dollar spent several minutes addressing the incident, starting with: 'I will say this emphatically: I should have never been arrested.' Dollar has strenuously denied the accusations, saying it was a family argument with 'heightened emotions'. The goal: Dollar wants a $65million Gulfstream G650 business jet, a plane favored by billionaires that bills itself as the fastest plane built in civil aviation . Influential: Dollar is the head of the World Changers Church International, a Christian ministry centered around the prosperity gospel, which preaches that God wants to bless the faithful with earthly riches . Dollar's wife Taffi has been known to introduce her husband at his sermons. During her address, she claims Dollar comes 'face to face with God, like Moses'. She also includes an admonition saying that 'every tongue that rises up against' (Dollar) 'will be struck down', Financial Juneteenth reported. The World Changers Church International (WCCI) has about 30,000 constituents.",

    "source": "Mothers and babies have been banned from special screenings at an independent cinema after staff became fed up with clearing away dirty nappies and oversized prams. The manager of The Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, cancelled the regular Tuesday baby matinees due to a combination of 'whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law'. James Hannaway, who restored and reopened the traditional cinema in 2004, announced the decision on the company's website. Scroll down for video . Ban: James Hannaway, manager of Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted, has banned babies from special screenings . He explained that the special screenings, which were introduced in 2007 after complaints over babies being allowed to all matinees, were to allow parents to enjoy adult films with their children. Mr Hannaway said he was fed up with the whingeing from those attending the screenings without babies, even though they declared they 'might contain babies'. 'Rex staff have enjoyed collecting still-warm nappies from under tables, and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks (prams) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank everywhere,' he said. And Mr Hannaway also claimed that the cinema has been forced to reconsider over the ratings on the Tuesday films. He said: 'Those who threatened us with the authorities if little-faces turn up in prams for a 15 certificate. Clearly babies of 0 to six months are under 15. 'Thank you for such moral vigilance. There's only so much whingeing, bitching and snitching from all sides one can take. Eight years of it is enough.' Screenings: He says he has cancelled the baby matinees (stock image) due to 'whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law' The issue had been picked up by members of the public, including Teresa Boad, who wrote on social media that she had 'complained about this a few years ago'. Some have been left disappointed by the ban, blaming other parents. Gillian Walters said: 'Shame how some spoil it for others leaving dirty nappies under tables is disgusting.' Clare Ball posted on the cinema's Facebook page: 'Very, very, very sad to see Tuesday matinee times have changed to 2pm, see you in a few years when I no longer have school runs in the afternoon.' The 1930s original Art Deco cinema has one screen in its\u00a0proscenium and was described by Visit the Chilterns tourist site as 'possibly Britain's most beautiful cinema'. It opened on May 9, 1938, with Heidi starring Shirley Temple and in the early 1970s the balcony was boxed off to create two screens in the upper circle. The\u00a0proscenium was soon closed and turned into a bingo hall while films still played in the smaller upstairs screen. On February 28, 1988, the cinema was closed and it would be 30 years before a film would be projected onto the screen. Beautiful: The 1930s original Art Deco cinema has one screen in its proscenium and was described by Visit the Chilterns tourist site as 'possibly Britain's most beautiful cinema' After its revival in 2004, complete with large, comfy seats and a full wine and snack menu, it has received great plaudits and opens with new titles most days and nights. The cinema claims to follow a simple formula involving 'civilised and enticing surroundings' with a 'warm atmosphere'. They also boast of cheap tickets and don't sell popcorn or hotdogs. Downstairs, in the stalls, are big red, swivel chairs at small, round, candlelit tables, with white tablecloths to the floor. Guest speakers over the years have included Martin Freeman, Imelda Saunton and Judy Dench among dozens of other familiar faces. From April babies are banned for, among other things, being under age. Not an easy decision. Here\u2019s why: Matinees included babies from the outset in 2005. The experiment proved difficult, too many complaints. so late in 2007 we had to restrict babies to Tuesdays only. It was included in the programme for young mums & dads to enjoy their first six months of bewilderment with a popular grown-up film at the Rex. Here, for a few short hours, they could be reminded that the world they had left was still here. It became, a meeting place, an escape into the latest films everybody (else) was talking about. Now, due to a combination of whingeing, bitching, snitching and the law, it is over. Whingeing: some without babies, upstairs would rarely miss the chance to complain, even though Tuesdays matinees declare 'might contain babies' and DO, DOES, DID! Bitching: as above but with the added missionary misery of Rex staff, who have enjoyed collecting still-warm nappies from under tables, and who put up with difficult first time mothers with armoured tanks (prams) and a not always helpful attitude as they spread everything from the tank, everywhere. Snitching: Those who threatened us with the Authorities if little-faces turn up in prams for a 15 certificate. Clearly babies 0to6 months are under 15. Thank you for such moral vigilance. There\u2019s only so much whingeing bitching and snitching from all sides, one can take. Eight years of it is enough. Finally, the Law, with little to resemble intelligence, decrees: only 12A, PG, U Certs with little or no adult bite, can be screened when babies are present. Sorry babies and parents your time is up. However, Saturday kids matinees are always under Certificate 15. So providing you can resist all of the headings above, take your warm nappies etc home, and leave the tanks outside, you\u2019re welcome. All matinees will start at 2pm.",

The firm's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to Facebook's site. Tinder also said it had improved its mutual friends feature. Scroll down for video . Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We\u2019ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there\u2019s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won\u2019t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out \u2018Tinder Plus\u2019, a premium service allowing people to \u2018undo\u2019 a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of \u2018likes\u2019 a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them \u2018You\u2019re Out of Likes\u2019, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says \u2018Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus\u2019. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around \u00a31.49 a month to as high as \u00a314.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay \u00a317.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping \u00a3179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying \u00a3162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.",

Mark O'Meara celebrates his winning putt in 1998 . 20 Mark O'Meara, 1998 . Aged 41, Mark O'Meara's chances of a major championship appeared to have gone despite a fine career and many victories on the PGA Tour. But O'Meara shot two birdies in three holes from the 15th on Sunday and a good approach into the 18th left him with a 20-footer to beat David Duval and Fred Couples. In the manner of his great friend Tiger Woods, he drained it. And he was soon handed his green jacket by Woods in the Butler Cabin. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . 19 Billy Joe Patton, 1954 . Billy Joe Patton came within a stroke of perhaps the biggest Masters shock of all but narrowly missed out on a play-off with Sam Snead and Ben Hogan. But for a short while it had appeared that an amateur golfer could topple two of the greatest ever to play the game, thanks to his hole-in-one on the par-three sixth on Sunday. Sadly, Patton's hopes were ultimately shot down by a double bogey on the 13th attempting to fly Rae's Creek and reach the green in two. Otherwise his ace would have featured near the very top of this list. Billy Joe Patton hits on the 13th hole... the scene of the double-bogey which ultimately cost him victory . CLICK HERE for the second part of our countdown, featuring videos of shots from the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Bubba Watson and Tiger Woods... 18 Seve Ballesteros, 1983 . Seve's second Masters victory featured what he called 'the best golf of my life' over the first four holes, and one 205-yard 2-iron on the fourth was utterly spectacular. But nothing quite sums up the genius of the late, great Spaniard than the way he clinched his four-shot victory over Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. An up and down for a bogey would have comfortably sewn up his victory, but showman Seve was having none of it and chipped in for a par four. 17 Byron Nelson, 1937 . Byron Nelson found himself a somewhat daunting six shots behind Ralph Guldahl in the final round of the 1937 tournament. But his comeback was complete on the par-five 13th after he found the cup with a chip for eagle from off the green, while his rival could only manage bogey. Lord Byron came from four strokes down to two ahead in just 25 minutes, and went on to win the first of his five majors by that same margin. Byron Nelson and club member Alfred Bourne at the presentation ceremony in 1937 . 16 Vijay Singh, 2009 . OK, so this isn't actually during the Masters itself, but have you ever seen anything like it? The big Fijian won the green jacket in 2000 but may not have hit a finer shot than this one during the annual par-three tournament on the Wednesday before the 2009 edition. Vijay skimmed his ball across a lake and watched as it rolled onto the green and into the cup for an ace. You'll need to see it to believe it. 15 Nick Faldo, 1989 . With dark descending, in dank drizzle and with wind whipping the course, Nick Faldo became only the second Briton ever to win the Masters after a play-off with Scott Hoch. His nerveless approach over the water on the 11th hole was good, but the putt was even better. Faldo recalled how his caddie, Andy Prodger, told him it was too dark to see the line of the shot, but he stroked it pure and right into the heart of the cup. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE SHOT . Nick Faldo celebrates his brilliant putt to win the Masters in a play-off in 1989 . 14 Charl Schwartzel, 2011 . Charl Schwartzel's victory three years ago is most famous for his rip-roaring finish - four birdies in the final four holes sealed his first major title - but his start was no less incredible. After missing the first green, the South African somehow chipped in from 100 feet for a remarkable birdie. And then, on the third, he slam-dunked his approach from the fairway for an eagle two. Two incredible shots, but the gods truly were smiling on Schwartzel that day. CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO . Charl Schwartzel (right) is presented with his green jacket by Phil Mickelson in 2011 . 13 Phil Mickelson, 2004 . Phil Mickelson had long carried the burden of being known as 'the best player never to have won a major' - just ask Lee Westwood how wearisome that feels. Lefty had a string of near-misses behind him - six second and third places - when he went toe-to-toe with Ernie Els over the back nine at Augusta that Sunday. And it all came down to the final green as Phil the Thrill sank an 18-footer for birdie under huge pressure to cast off that unwanted reputation once and for all. 12 Fuzzy Zoeller, 1979 . Imagine playing in your very first Masters... and standing over a putt to win, in a sudden-death play-off. It was the first time the Masters had been decided in such a way, was played in the gathering gloom and also included Ed Sneed and the great Tom Watson. In near darkness, Zoeller held his nerve to sink his birdie putt on the 11th hole and make history. 11 Louis Oosthuizen, 2012 . Some might argue that this is the best shot in Masters history - but some would also say it wasn't even the best shot of the day (see the countdown from 10-1). Whatever, it's hard to think of a more perfectly envisioned, controlled and executed long iron in the history of the game. Oosthuizen catapulted himself into the lead (and an eventual play-off) with this 253-yard approach into the par-five second hole that pitched on a sixpence at the front of the green. From then on, it was never going anywhere other than the centre of the cup. Louis Oosthuizen raises his arms and soaks it all in after holing out for an albatross at Augusta in 2012 .",

Mrs Davison-Lemalle said: 'It's a miracle. Around a month ago, my dad drove to the garage in Llanrwst and as he got out of the car, he thought he saw a cat running off in the corner of his eye. 'At the time he thought nothing of it and didn't say anything but when we got home that afternoon George was nowhere to be seen. 'We think George must have sneaked into the car and ran towards the caravan site that is nearby. 'We can't think of any other way of him getting to Yorkshire other than stowing away in a vehicle or caravan belonging to a tourist. 'It's absolutely bonkers to think he travelled so far. We won't be letting him out of our sight ever again.' She revealed her pet had been was rescued from the Bryn-y-Maen animal shelter in Colwyn Bay when he was a kitten and was living with her parents when he disappeared. Her mother, Susan, said: 'Goodness only knows how he got that far - he's always been a curious cat but he's never done anything like this before. He has now been reunited with owners Steven Davison and his wife Susan (pictured together with George) 'We thought we'd lost him for good so it's amazing to have him back. We're over the moon.' But the mammoth cross-country journey took its toll on the 18-year-old cat and when the family went to collect him they realised he had cat flu. 'When we got there we realised he wasn't very well. He had cat flu,' said Gemma. 'He's back where he belongs and he is happy and settled.' Ms Hill, who found George and started the appeal, said the cat was 'poorly, thin and grumpy' when he turned up on her doorstep. 'The cat just turned up outside my house last week,' she said. Gemma Davison-Lemalle, 30, saw a picture of her childhood pet on the Facebook group and got in touch . The 128-mile journey from Llanrwst in the Conwy Valley to Calderdale, West Yorkshire, would have taken a minimum of four-and-a-half hours including two bus trips and three train changes . 'I took him to the local vets to see if he was chipped and they found he was registered to an address in North Wales. 'He was so poorly, thin and grumpy, I think he may have died if we hadn't taken pity on him. She added: 'I'm sad he's gone but I'm really pleased he has gone home to his owners. 'Steve and Sue were so pleased to see him, he was sat outside when they arrived. 'It's still a mystery how he got here, but hopefully he's none the worse for his adventure.' The 128-mile journey would have taken a minimum of four-and-a-half hours including two bus trips and three train changes. Gemma said: 'We can't thank Julia enough for taking such good care of him for us. We're so excited to have him back.'

And no wonder, this stunning city of marble palaces, ancient churches, canals and waterways is a magnet for those in love. Come May, lovers of art will be flocking to the city too as it plays host to its Biennale Art Festival, an exhibition when over 88 nations showcase their country's best works of art in national pavilions dotted throughout the city. So if you're heading there then, get a taste of 'la Dolce Vita' Clooney-style by taking in some of the places the couple made their own and the beautiful scenery that provided the backdrops for their wedding celebrations. Scroll down for video . The Belmond Hotel Cipriani is on the island of Giudecca, just a few minutes by water taxi from Saint Mark\u2019s Square. The views from its restaurant are magnificent . George and Amal's wedding celebrations lasted over the course of a whole weekend and were at some of Venice's most exclusive venues . Where to stay: George's favourite hotel . George loves the Belmond Hotel Cipriani. It was here that both he and Amal, as well as many of their celebrity friends, based themselves during the wedding weekend. Guests at the hotel can try two special cocktails that George created with head barman Walter Bolzonella \u2013 \u2018Nina\u2019s Passion\u2019 (named after Clooney\u2019s mother) and \u2018Buonanotte\u2019 (Italian for 'Good Night' in honour of Clooney\u2019s film Good Night, Good Luck). The hotel is on the island of Giudecca, a sliver of land just 300 metres wide and 1.5miles in length, but its views of some of Venice's most famous landmarks like St Mark's Square and the Doge's Palace are spectacular. The Belmond Hotel Cipriani has double garden view rooms starting from \u00a3477 per night, including breakfast and taxes . The hotel's heated swimming pool, set in extensive gardens, is filled with heated seawater and is the only hotel pool in central Venice . Where to eat: The Stag Party restaurant . Clooney kicked the celebrations off with a stag do at one of his favourite eateries in the city, a traditional-style restaurant called Da Ivo, serving food from Northern Italy. George \u2013 a regular patron \u2013 is believed to have given manager pal Giovanni Fracassi just ten minutes\u2019 notice prior to turning up with his stag party friends, among them former supermodel Cindy Crawford\u2019s husband Rande Gerber. The groom ordered five courses followed by two puddings. His party also worked their way through dishes including antipasto and pasta with truffles during their stay at the restaurant, after which a satisfied George personally thanked resident chef Giorgina Mazzero. The bill is believed to have been around \u00a33,000 but was waived by manager Giovanni Fracassi. George Clooney leaving the Belmond Hotel Cipriani (left) on his way by watertaxi to Ristorante Ivo (right), where he held his stag party . Rande Gerber had also brought several bottles of tequila, which the group enjoyed after their dinner at the exclusive eatery. Producing partner Grant Heslov was also there along with several other of his male companions. Where to soak up the romance: The wedding hotel . George and Amal chose to have their celebrations before they signed the papers to be officially wed. Guests included Cindy Crawford, Bill Murray, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon, U2 lead singer Bono and US Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. And they couldn't have chosen a better venue, Venice's only 'seven star' hotel, the super swanky Aman Canal Grande. Located on the Grand Canal and offering glorious views across the city, the hotel has rooms bedecked with historic frescoes and hallways that ooze opulence with hand-crafted chandeliers made on the nearby island of Murano, . It was opened in the 450-year-old Palazzo Papadopoli in 2013 and offers rooms starting in price from an eye-watering \u20ac850 (\u00a3609) per night, excluding tax and service, but including airport transfers by boat.

The Aman Canal Grande Venice is located just opposite the Cavalli Palace where George and Amal tied in the knot in their official ceremony .

The palace in which the Aman Canal Grande is housed was built in 1550 for a wealthy Venetian family of traders and seafarers . Where to wed: The 16th-century registry office . The final stage in the Clooneys' whirlwind wedding tour of Venice was when they made it all legal in the official ceremony at a Venetian registry office. They an had a choice of three venues -\u00a0Cavalli Palace, C\u00e0 Farsetti, and C\u00e0 Vendramin Calergi. In the end George and Amal chose the Cavalli Palace, a 16th-century Renaissance building in the heart of the city opposite the Aman Canal Grande and close to the famous Rialto Bridge. Its light-filled hall overlooking the Grand Canal makes it a favourite choice for couples getting married. Couples from all over the world flock to Venice to get hitched. Prices for an official ceremony start from \u20ac400 (\u00a3286) for EU citizens and \u20ac1,600 (\u00a31,150) for those from outside the European Union. The bride and groom left on a vaporetto (water taxi) appropriately called 'Amore' accompanied by a flotilla of boats bobbing down the Grand Canal, looking like for all the world like a modern-day version of a painting by Canaletto. George and Amal (left) about to enter the Cavalli Palace (right), where they married - it has incredible views over the city's Grand Canal .

    "source": "An New Jersey police lieutenant who pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after allegedly masturbating in a Starbucks says his post-traumatic stress disorder is to blame. In May 2014, Benito Gonzalez Jr.,46, was suspended from duty after being arrested for allegedly exposing his genitals and touching himself inappropriately while seated at a table in a Cherry Hill Starbucks, police say. A surveillance photo posted to the Cherry Hill police Facebook page led to the 17-year Camden police veteran's arrest -- the photo has since been deleted and is now being used as evidence, the\u00a0Courier-Post\u00a0reports. Blame: Benito Gonzalez, 46 (photographed),\u00a0who pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after allegedly masturbating in a Starbucks says his post-traumatic stress disorder is to blame . The father-of-three was found guilty of the offense last month and is currently suspended without pay, the Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0reports . While county officials are working to fire the lieutenant's, the Post reports, Gonzalez claims the incident -- which he says he does not remember -- is the culmination of a three-year downward spiral following a traumatic experience more than three years ago, the  Inquirer\u00a0\u00a0reports. It all began in June 2011 when Gonzalez, who ran the department's narcotics unit, had an encounter with a drug dealer, 32-year-old Adam Reed. In the altercation, Gonzalez dived to the ground, injuring his hamstrings, as Reed fired shots at him from a handgun. Reed then pointed the gun at Gonzalez's head and pulled the trigger. But the weapon malfunctioned, saving Gonzalez's life, and Reed was later sentenced to 66 years in prison, the Inquirer reports. 'I just saw my life completely over,' Gonzalez told the Inquirer, 'I thought I was dead.' Gonzalez's career seemed to flourish and the 46-year-old was even promoted to lieutenant in 2013. But Gonzalez said he used his job as a way to escape his crumbling mental health. Starbucks: Police Say Gonzalez walked into this Starbucks in Cherry Hill, while off-duty, pulled down his pants and masturbated at one of the coffee-shops tables . In evaluations after the incident, psychologists recognized that Gonzalez had issues linked to the trauma and reportedly gave him the task of deciding whether to stay with the department. He chose to stay and tried hiding his problems from his co-workers telling the Inquirer that he didn't want to seem 'weak' or incapable of dong his job. In the years following the incident, Gonzalez would be diagnosed with PTSD, suffer panic attacks, experience flashbacks of the traumatic incident, and even contemplate suicide. It was not long after considering suicide that Gonzalez, while off-duty, walked into the Starbucks on Route 70 and committed the lewd act. Gonzales claims he was intoxicated and in a blackout state as a result of the trauma and only remembers drinking before going to the Starbucks and returning home that night, the Inquirer reports. He said he did not know he had been at the Starbucks until police contacted him and told him he was being charged. Gonzalez is set to appear at an administrative hearing Wednesday where his attorney will ask the department to briefly reinstate the lieutenant so he could apply for his more than $60,000 accidental-disability pension -- which law enforcement officials can receive after suffering disabilities from an incident, the Inquirer reports. The pension represents a majority of Gonzalez's income, needed to provide for his wife and three children, aged 16, 15, and 8. His wife says she fears the family will have to move from its home due to the financial strain. While the fate of Gonzalez's pension is unknown, the Post reports that a judge last month approved Gonzalez's participation in a conditional dismissal program. The program would require Gonzalez to undergo a one-year probationary period where he would be monitored. If he does not violate the probation, the lewdness charge could be dismissed, and he could have the charge expunged from his records six months later.",

    "source": "Patrice Evra believes Juventus called upon quintessential Italian traits in securing their route to the Champions League semi-finals, describing the Sere A side's defeat of Monaco as  'ugly'. Massimiliano Allegri's team secured a 0-0 draw at the Stade Louis II on Wednesday night, meaning they progressed 1-0 on aggregate, after  Arturo Vidal's second-half penalty proved the difference in Turin last week. Evra withstood a few nervous moments as Juventus sat back and allowed the French side to dictate the play, but after helping the Italians reach their first Champions League semi-final since 2002-03, the former Manchester United full back claimed that Ligue 1's elite clubs could learn from a more combative style of play. Patrice Evra prevents Monaco's Yannick Ferreira Carrasco from delivering a cross at the\u00a0Stade Louis II . Evra is put under pressure by Monaco's Geoffrey Kondogbia during Wednesday night's quarter-final clash . 'I'm not scientist but for Paris Saint-Germain to lose to a big club like Barcelona and Monaco to lose to an experienced team like Juventus, but I think that in France we're okay being the country that finishes second,' the French defender told beIN Sports after the game. 'We'll have to take the next step, to have a different mentality. You have to respect the opponent but be more aggressive on the pitch. 'I think the French teams sometimes doubt themselves. They play some beautiful games but when it comes down to it, do not go through. 'We must give a nod to Monaco, who deserved more tonight. But, from our point of view, we never really doubted ourselves. 'We played the Italian way - it's solid, it's ugly, but it works. I am happy and at the same time a little sad for Monaco. It was strange to return to Stade Louis II, where I spent many happy years.' Injury meant Paul Pogba sat out the Monaco clash and he is likely to miss the Champions League semi-finals .

    "source": "Arrested: Veteran William Snyder, 34, has been charged in connection with the disappearance and death of his wife, Kelley Jo Snyder, 34 . The husband of a Pennsylvania mother of three has been charged with abuse of a corpse and evidence-tampering after the discovery of her body over the weekend. Army-veteran William Snyder, 34, was charged hours after the body of his wife, Kelley Jo Snyder, 34, was found in a river near to their home on Saturday. She was last seen alive on Easter Sunday. Police in Renovo say that Snyder has admitted moving the body from their home and also having fabricated a ransom note seeking $60,000 for his wife's safe return. Coroner Zachary Hanna said the cause and manner of death are pending results of toxicology tests. State police have said they expect more charges to be filed after the results are published. Snyder is currently in the Clinton County Correctional Facility on $500,000 bail and was arrested at a motel in the small town of Horseheads on Friday in New York after presumably fleeing last week. He was returned across the state border and charged the next day. A police affidavit seen by PennLive.com\u00a0claims that Snyder, who uses the name BJ, has admitted removing his wife's body from their home and taking it to the Halls Run river. Recovered: The body of Shelley Jo Snyder was found in a river near to where she lived with her husband . Day out: William and Shelley-Jo Snyder with their son on a day out to the Met Life stadium in New Jersey . He is the alleged to have sent a ransom note to a local restaurant, himself and an email to police demanding money for her safe return. Snyder first reported his wife missing at 12.01 on the Monday following Easter Sunday sparking a huge search of the local area. Snyder and her three children said they had last seen Kelly Jo leave the family home at at around 5.45pm right before they sat down to eat their Easter dinner. She is supposed to have left the home to pick up sweet potatoes, but police claim she never made it the store. Police said they spoke to her 14-year-old son and he told them she had taken her wallet, bank card and identification with her. Family affair: Shelley-Jo was last seen at just before 6.00pm on Easter Sunday when she told her family she was going to buy some sweet potatoes . On Wednesday, during the search of the neighborhood, BJ's sister, T.T. Wertz found her sister-in-laws waller near to her house even though the area had been thoroughly searched. On Tuesday, Snyder spoke to Newswatch 16 before his wife's body was discovered. 'We just hope if she is out there and can see this or someone sees this and has any info to get a hold of us,' said Snyder to the local news station. In court papers, Snyder has admitted to sending the ransom note to his own address and to a local restaurant and an email to police before he was arrested. Neighbors of the pair have expressed disbelief at the turn of events. 'I think they are wrong. I don\u2019t think it was him, so I think they need to do a little more investigating other than pinning on the husband,' said Faith Marr, a neighbor to Newswatch 16.",

Scroll down for video . A 1921 application form to join the racist Ku Klux Klan organisation has emerged .

In a blog post Brabner explained that the numbers \u20188-2-21\u2019 in the top left corner of the unused form would have stood for the date \u2013 August 2, 1921. He wrote: \u2018You can assume there\u2019s a fair amount of xenophobic sentiment and anxiety about the waves of immigration to America, in 1921, post World-War One. \u2018On May 9, 1921, this was evidenced when Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, aka, the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921 to counter the increased immigration to America.\u2019 The form is ominously titled \u2018Invisible Empire\u2019, an alternative name for the clan at the time, born from founder Nathan Bedford Forrest\u2019s claim that the group was \u2018invisible\u2019. The KKK was founded in 1866 in Tennessee, with Nathan Bedford Forrest becoming the first leader, or grand wizard, in 1867. Pictured are clan members in 1965 .

It was recently revealed, meanwhile, that California had more active hate groups than any other state last year. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), California has 57 such groups, followed by Florida with 50, New York with 44, New Jersey with 40, and Pennsylvania with 38. Rounding out the top five were Texas with 36 hate groups, Tennessee with 29, Georgia with 28, and Virginia and Ohio tied with 27 each. Hawaii and Alaska were the only states to not have any hate groups, according to the SPLC. The organization said on its website 'All hate groups have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics. 'This list was compiled using hate group publications and websites, citizen and law enforcement reports, field sources and news reports. 'Websites appearing to be merely the work of a single individual, rather than the publication of a group, are not included in this list,' the organization wrote. 'Listing here does not imply a group advocates or engages in violence or other criminal activity.' Nationally, the SPLC said in its 'The Year in Hate and Extremism' report, which was published online this spring, that there were a total 784 active hate groups in the US. The non-profit said there were 72 Ku Klux Klan groups, 142 neo-Nazi groups, 115 White Nationalist groups, 119 racist skinhead groups, 21 Christian identity groups, 37 neo-confederate groups, 113 black separatist groups, and 165 general hate groups.",

    "source": "Barry Bonds has been cleared legally after 11 1/2 years in court. His reputation remains tainted in the mind of many baseball fans. A federal court of appeals threw out the career home run leader's obstruction of justice conviction on Wednesday, ruling 10-1 that his meandering answer before a grand jury in 2003 was not material to the government's investigation into illegal steroids distribution. 'Today's news is something that I have long hoped for,' Bonds said in a statement. Overturned: In this April 13, 2011, file photo, former baseball player Barry Bonds leaves federal court in San Francisco, after being found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice . On April 22, 2015, reversed the sole conviction against baseball slugger Barry Bonds, pictured in 2011, and said he could not be tried again on an obstruction of justice charge that resulted from a steroids probe . 'I am humbled and truly thankful for the outcome as well as the opportunity our judicial system affords to all individuals to seek justice.' Now 50, Bonds said 'I am excited about what the future holds for me as I embark on the next chapter.' Bonds broke Hank Aaron's long-standing career record of 755 homers in 2007, finished that season with 762 and was indicted that December for his testimony before a grand jury investigating the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, when he answered a question about injections by saying he was 'a celebrity child.' He was convicted of the obstruction charge in 2011, and a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the conviction in 2013. But the larger group, which listened to arguments from prosecutors and Bonds' lawyers last September, concluded there was insufficient evidence his initial evasive answer was material to the grand jury's probe. 'The most one can say about this statement is that it was non-responsive and thereby impeded the investigation to a small degree by wasting the grand jury's time and trying the prosecutors' patience,' Judge Alex Kozinski wrote. baseball player: Pittsburgh Pirates Barry Bonds sits in the dugout at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium before his first major league start against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Pittsburgh, May 30, 1986 . 'Real-life witness examinations, unlike those in movies and on television, invariably are littered with non-responsive and irrelevant answers.' Jessica Wolfram, one of the jurors who convicted Bonds following the three-week trial and four days of deliberations, said she couldn't help but feel the decade-long prosecution was 'all a waste, all for nothing.' 'Just a waste of money, having the whole trial and jury,' she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. In testifying before the grand jury, Bonds claimed he didn't realize substances he used were illegal performance-enhancing drugs. The appellate judges based their decision on legal issues involving witness testimony, not the underlying facts. Despite holding the career and season home run marks - he hit a single-year record 73 in 2001 - Bonds has been denied entry into baseball's Hall of Fame by baseball writers. He appeared on 36.8 percent of ballots this year, less than half the 75 percent needed. 'I think sadly his reputation has been tarnished, not because of the indictment or the reversal, but because of all the PED use,' former baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent said. 'I think the public has made up its mind.' Barry Bonds, pictured in 2011, was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement and two years probation after a jury found Barry Bonds guilty on one count of obstruction of justice . Roger Clemens, whose pitching feats were as accomplished as Bonds' batting achievements, also has been denied Hall entry. Clemens was acquitted in 2012 of criminal charges he lied to Congress when he denied using PEDs. Travis Tygart, chief executive officer of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, called the decision \"almost meaningless for the real issue, which is whether he used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat the fans of baseball.\" 'I think at the end of the day America knows the truth and who the real home run record holder is, who did it the right way, and it's obviously not Barry Bonds,' he said. Following the trial that opened in March 2011, a jury deadlocked on three counts charging Bonds with making false statements when he denied receiving steroids and human growth hormone from personal trainer Greg Anderson and denied receiving injections from Anderson or his associates. Bonds was convicted for his response when he was asked whether Anderson ever gave him 'anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with.' 'That's what keeps our friendship,' Bonds said. 'I was a celebrity child, not just in baseball by my own instincts. I became a celebrity child with a famous father. I just don't get into other people's business because of my father's situation, you see.' Thumbs up: In this Sept. 6, 2014, file photo, career home run leader Barry Bonds gives a thumbs up while standing behind the batting cage and watching the Houston Astros take batting practice . Judges divided on their rationale, issuing four separate opinions to reverse the conviction and one to uphold it. The appeals court barred a retrial, citing a prohibition on double jeopardy. Kozinski, writing for himself and four other judges, was concerned the obstruction statute, 'stretched to its limits ... poses a significant hazard for everyone involved in our system of justice, because so much of what the adversary process calls for could be construed as obstruction.' Wolfram remembered there being some confusion among the jurors over the fact that Bonds did answer the question later in his grand jury testimony. Bonds did not testify at the trial. Judge Johnnie B. Rawlinson, the only member of the court to back prosecutors, wrote an opinion filled with baseball references that began 'there is no joy in this dissenting judge,' added the judges who sided with Bonds 'have struck out' and concluded 'I cry foul.' The government could ask the 11-judge panel to reconsider Wednesday's decision or could request that all 29 judges on the 9th Circuit rehear the case - which has never happened since the court began using the \"limited en banc\" panels in 1980. Prosecutors also could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision. 'I could not be more happy that Barry Bonds finally gets to move on with his life,' BALCO founder Victor Conte said. No crime: Former Major League Baseball player Barry Bonds greets a fan as he leaves federal court following a sentencing hearing on December 16, 2011 in San Francisco, California . 'Let's hope the prosecutors choose not to waste any more resources on what has been nothing more than a frivolous trophy-hunt and a complete waste of taxpayer dollars.' A seven-time NL MVP and the son of three-time All-Star Bobby Bonds, Barry Bonds earned $192.8 million from the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants during a professional career from 1985-07 and could afford a legal team that outnumbered the government's 13-5 in the court room. He was sentenced in 2011 by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston to 30 days of home confinement, two years of probation, 250 hours of community service in youth-related activities and a $4,000 fine. He already has served the home confinement. Illston declared a mistrial on the three other counts, and the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco dismissed those charges in August 2011. The U.S. attorney's office declined comment on the decision. 'I think the 10-1 vote indicates that it was a farce,' said Bonds' appellate lawyer, Dennis Riordan. 'The greatest impact is the damage it undid. We had a panel opinion that said if you're asked a question on page 78 and you digress before you answer it directly on page 81, you're a federal felon.' In 2009 and `10, the 9th Circuit ruled federal agents illegally seized urine samples and testing records of major league players, with Kozinski saying it 'was an obvious case of deliberate overreaching by the government.' The 9th Circuit three-judge panel ruled in 2010 the government could not present positive urine samples at Bonds' trial because Anderson refused to testify and there was no witness to authenticate the evidence.",

    "source": "An eccentric man is fighting to keep his driving licence photo as a picture of him with a colander on his head because it is his 'religious right'. Ian Harris, 51, from Brighton, East Sussex, is a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster whose followers, known as Pastafarians, regard the pasta strainer as a religious garment. He is challenging the DVLA over his rights to wear the metal bowl in his licence photo, which he says is equivalent to Muslim women being pictured in hijabs. Ian Harris is a member of the\u00a0Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, whose followers believe the colander is a religious garment and he is fighting with the DVLA for his right to wear one in his driving licence photo . The father-of-one has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear in a second bid. Mr Harris said: 'I'm fighting for the right to have my religious headgear shown on my photo. I don't understand the DVLA should be able to discriminate whether my religion is valid. 'I have a spiritual connection with the Flying Spaghetti Monster, until they have brain probes how are they going to say I don't? 'Our religion is a minority but the DVLA is discriminating because it allows people who practise major religions to wear headgear in pictures.' The musician had his appeal rejected last month but hopes to emulate fellow believer Niko Alm from Austria, who won the legal right to wear the headgear in his licence photo in 2011. Mr Alm sent off for the licence in 2008 and he was invited to the doctor's to check he was mentally fit to drive, but after three years, his efforts finally paid off. Mr Harris began following the religion, along with his daughter Astri, 4, after it was set up in the USA in 2005 to protest the teaching of creationism as an alternative to evolution in science classes. Members claim to believe that an invisible alien made of spaghetti and meatballs created the universe after 'drinking heavily.' According to its tongue-in-cheek website their 'only dogma ... is the rejection of dogma'. Rejection: Mr Harris has already been turned down once by the government agency but has sent off a fresh photo wearing the headgear and in a second bid . A DVLA spokesman said: 'The photograph must be clear and be a current likeness to allow the Police to link the driver to driving entitlement held without confusion or ambiguity. 'Headgear is generally not acceptable, but may be permissible on religious or medical grounds and any exemptions are dealt with on a case by case basis.' Religious exemptions include the Sikh turban and the Islamic Hijab. Mr Harris, who plays banjo in The Iron Boot Scrapers, vows to fight his corner until he runs out of appeals when he will be forced to send a photo of him without the colander. He said: 'When I get to the final appeal I will have to send a photo without a colander but that would be a bad day for religious freedom.' Other countries including the United States, Austria and the Czech Republic allow Pastafarians to wear the metal sieves in their licence pictures. The Austrian authorities allowed Niko Alm to wear the unusual headgear as it is deemed a suitable accessory for his 'Pastafarian' religion . Shawna Hammon from Oklahoma was allowed to pose for her driver's license wearing a spaghetti strainer on her head because it falls under the state's rules for religious headwear . In September last year Shawna Hammond from Oklahoma, U.S. was granted permission to wear one in her licence photograph. She said  the photo obeyed the state's laws that requires people remove their glasses and wear a religious headpiece that does not cover their face, create shadows, or display text or logos. Earlier that year, Christopher Schaeffer, a council member in Pomfret, New York wore a colander on his head as he was sworn into office. In 2013, a Czech man was allowed to wear the headgear on his official identity card after officials ruled that turning down his request would be a breach of the country's religious equality laws. In 2005, a physics graduate from Oregon State wrote a letter about a 'Flying Spaghetti Monster' as a form of protest against the Kansas State Board of Education's decision to allow the teaching of Intelligent Design as an alternative to evolution in public schools. By professing belief in a supernatural entity composed of pasta and meatballs, Bobby Henderson, 24, called on 'Pastafarianism' to be given equal time in science classrooms alongside Christian theory. Word rapidly spread and the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (CFSM) now has thousands of followers, mainly on college campuses and in Europe. The central tenet of CFSM is that an invisible Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe 'after drinking heavily'. Pastafarians celebrate every Friday as a holy day - and consider pirates 'absolute divine beings'.",

'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off.

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged outside Sydney Harbour this morning. Due to dock at 7:15 the ship is currently sitting off Sydney Heads. The ship has suffered damage in wild weather conditions off the NSW coast. The hand railing and pedestal lighting has been damaged while a cover over the satellite system (above) has also been damaged and removed for safety reasons . The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas . Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves . The Carnival Spirit has 2500 passengers on board, stranded outside of Sydney Harbour because of the city's wild weather . Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves, which began crashing into the ship late on Monday and have continued unabated, amid reports that there has been some damage. 'High winds have caused minor damage to some external features such as an equipment cover and some partitioning, while heavy rains have dampened some doorway carpets,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This damage is superficial and has not affected the ship\u2019s operation in any way.\u00a0Guests and crew are safe and the Captain is ensuring guests are as comfortable as possible.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore and more passengers have been recounting their wild ride. 'It\u2019s not pleasant, it\u2019s been like this all night,' one woman told ABC radio. 'I don\u2019t think many people got much sleep.' Carnival Cruise Lines officials confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that Carnival Spirit was scheduled to arrive 'early this morning' but was unable to do so because of the rough seas. 'The scheduled Sydney arrival of Carnival Cruise Lines\u2019 Carnival Spirit has been delayed due to severe weather which has led to the closure of Sydney port and prevented the Harbour Pilot from boarding the ship,' the statement said. 'The ship is now waiting off the Sydney coast line until the port is re-opened.' And nothing can be done until conditions ease to allow the regulatory process to take place. 'It is mandatory maritime requirement for a Harbour Pilot to board any ship before it enters Sydney port,' Carnival Cruise Lines stated further. 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open.' Eleven metre waves have been recorded off-shore as the cruise ship Carnival Spirit remains stranded outside Sydney Harbour . Waves of nine metres have been battering the ship for the past 24 hours. The Carnival Spirit remains stuck outside Sydney Heads due to the swell and may not be able to enter the harbour for 48 hours . Carnival Cruise Liners in statement said: 'Guests and crew are safe and comfortable and the ship is continuing to offer a full program of on-board activities and entertainment while it waits for the harbour to re-open' In a further statement placed on social media, to those travellers caught out by the drama, they said: 'We are sorry to announce that Carnival Spirit will be unable to sail from Sydney today as the port of Sydney has been closed due to extreme weather and ships are not permitted to enter Sydney Harbour.' 'For guests scheduled to depart for the South Pacific on S512, the Captain is working on a revised 7-day itinerary departing tomorrow, weather permitting. The revised itinerary will visit Isle of Pines and Noumea, but not the originally scheduled port of Mare.' The Ports Authority warned that passengers were in for some more discomfort, with little chance of the ship being able to dock on Tuesday, with the adverse weather conditions expected to worsen as another storm cell pushes into Sydney.",

Dr Adam Cobb\u00a0was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr. If convicted he faces 20 years' jail in the US. Dr Adam Cobb was taken into custody on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for receipt and distribution of child pornography\u00a0after allegedly uploading images of child pornography to the social networking site, Tumblr . The 45-year-old was in the US working as a research professor and director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island. Cobb took up the position at the US Naval War College in June last year after holding senior military and government roles in Australia and the US, including a recent strategic policy and planning position at US Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. 'I can confirm that he was a civilian employee and director of the Mahan Advanced Research Project at the US Naval War College,' Captain Christopher Dicomitis, a Rhode Island State Police detective, told AAP on Sunday. Cobb appeared in the US District Court in Providence on Friday and was refused bail. An investigation began in January when The National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children reported an individual in Rhode Island had uploaded child pornography to Tumblr. The internet connection at Cobb's Portsmouth home was identified as the origin of the images. Cobb was in the US working as a  director at the prestigious US Naval War College in Rhode Island\u00a0after holding senior military and government roles in Australia, including the RAAF . Laptops and mobile phones were seized from his home, while photos and videos of two females were also discovered on a storage device and a computer allegedly belonging to Cobb. Educated at the University of Sydney, Australian National University and University of Cambridge, Cobb built a reputation as a leading military thinker. According to his biography on the US Naval War College website, Cobb worked on the 1999-2000 East Timor crisis with Major General Cosgrove, who at the time was commander of the international peacekeeping mission. 'Overall, my commanders and I found Dr Cobb's work a valuable contribution to our understanding of important issues before us,' Maj Gen Cosgrove wrote in a review of Cobb's work as lead analyst for the Australian Parliament Defence Office. In Australia he was special-director, strategic policy with the RAAF; senior defence adviser for the Australian parliament; an Australian parliamentary fellow; and research fellow at Australian National University's strategic and defence studies centre. Cobb has also worked at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC and was on the staff of former speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

    "source": "The Shepherd\u2019s Life: A Tale\u00a0of the Lake District . by James Rebanks . (Allen Lane \u00a316.99) When, in 2002, my family and I moved from busy North London to bucolic north Herefordshire, we found that our new neighbours were, overwhelmingly, sheep. I didn\u2019t want to be one of those townies who moves to the country but remains ignorant of rural ways, so I made sporadic efforts to get to know them, or at least, to get to understand life on a sheep farm. When my children were small, I asked the obliging farmer whose land abuts our garden if they could watch his ewes lambing. And I still often tell him that I\u2019d like to spend some time alongside him, to see how his days unfold. To which he always smiles, no doubt wondering, metropolitan softie that I still really am, how I\u2019d cope with the early starts and the relentless physical graft. This wonderful book has filled in most of the gaps in my education, without any 4.30am alarm calls. James Rebanks studied at the University of Oxford before returning to his roots in the Lake District, he is seen here with his sheep on his farm outside of Penrith in Cumbria . It is the enlightening, exquisitely written account, give or take a few autobiographical tangents, of a year in the life of James Rebanks, whose family has been farming in the Lake District for at least six centuries. He was born into a job from which, now in his 40s, he takes infinite pride. All the same, it is no life for the faint-hearted. Every year, spring and autumn feel like flimsy bookends to a long, harsh winter, and his Herdwick sheep \u2014 descended, he thinks, from animals that arrived with the Vikings \u2014 are built for the fells in ways that even the hardiest shepherds are not. Making hay, linked by an old proverb to images of glorious sunny days, can be \u2018a bitch of a job\u2019. And while working with livestock is a series of small, predictable daily challenges, sometimes the challenges are bigger, and not at all predictable. With starkly effective prose, he brilliantly evokes the horror of the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. After police snipers had arrived on his farm, \u2018the fields were speckled with our dead cattle . . . Strangely peaceful, they lay in all sorts of mangled and contorted ways. I knew those cattle, so it was like seeing old friends dead\u2019. As for the sheep, 95 per cent of the world\u2019s Herdwicks live within 20 miles of Coniston, and were in danger of extinction. \u2018But an essentially urban government didn\u2019t understand. To them, a sheep was a sheep, a farm simply a farm. The idea that something precious was on the edge of destruction was never really grasped.\u2019 It is a farmer\u2019s lot, adds Rebanks, to depend on the whims of others: of bureaucrats, supermarket buyers, shoppers. Alas, most of them have no understanding of the proud, beleaguered culture he comes from, just like the secondary school teachers who told him that farming on the Lakeland fells was a dead-end business, a waste of brainpower. Anyone with even a sliver of ambition and character, they suggested, would seek a life elsewhere. And although one teacher talked rhapsodically about the Lakes, it was in terms the disdainful teenage Rebanks simply could not comprehend. \u2018The Lake District in her monologue was the playground for an itinerant band of climbers, poets, walkers and daydreamers . . . people who, unlike our parents, or us, had \u201creally done something\u201d. Occasionally, she would utter a name such as Wordsworth, or Wainwright, \u2018and look in vain for us to understand\u2019. Rebanks loathed school, and left at 15, able to write only in block capitals. But his book does not undermine the importance of education \u2014 far from it. Toiling on the farm, he found himself at odds with his decent, hard-working but obstreperous father, and escaped by reading, which he had resisted so strongly during his schooldays. One day he pulled off a shelf A Shepherd\u2019s Life, written in 1910 by W.H. Hudson, just knowing \u2018it was going to be lousy and patronising\u2019. It was the exact opposite. It was about families like his, and it inspired him to read more, learn more. At 21, he took his A-levels at evening classes in nearby Carlisle, where in due course they told him that he might actually be Oxbridge material. On his application form for Oxford he described himself as a \u2018drystone wall builder on the Lake District fells\u2019. Natural charm and a certain northern pugnaciousness helped him breeze through his interview, but in \u2018every conversation for the next three years\u2019 he had to suffer someone saying what a big change Oxford must represent after life on the farm. One professor ventured that he would miss his old existence, after graduating. \u2018I told him that I hadn\u2019t stopped doing it, that I was going back. He seemed quite confused by this.\u2019 Rebanks never contemplated not going back. He applied his brain and brawn to running the farm that had belonged to his grandfather and father, and lives there today with his wife and three children. That Oxford degree is not wasted; in a fleeting, almost throwaway paragraph, he tells us that he is also an \u2018expert adviser\u2019 to the Unesco World Heritage Centre in Paris, helping them understand how tourism can benefit host communities. But then, nor is it wasted in the work he does on the farm, a job more reliant than most on skill and judgment. Breeding from the best rams, or \u2018tups\u2019, he suggests, is more intellectually challenging than much of what he did at Oxford. At sales, he adds, everyone tries to get their tup to stand correctly, broad and thick-set and with their heads up, giving an impression of arrogance, \u2018like Russell Crowe in Gladiator\u2019. I was beguiled by this book, such an eloquent love letter to a cherished way of life, and more specifically, to his grandparents and parents, to whom he was born not with a silver spoon in his mouth, but a wooden crook in his hand. Perhaps above all it is a love letter to the Lake District, which I know well from my own Lancashire childhood, but only as a place to visit, not to live in. As Rebanks makes abundantly clear \u2014 not least with his effusive praise for a famous children\u2019s author, whom he thinks of not as the creator of Peter Rabbit, nor even as Beatrix Potter, but as Mrs Heelis, doughty champion of Herdwick sheep \u2014 there is, between the two, all the difference in the world.",

    "source": "Arsene Wenger wants Cesc Fabregas to be shown the \u2018respect he deserves\u2019 when he returns to the Emirates Stadium in the blue of Chelsea on Sunday. The problem with that is a decent chunk of Arsenal\u2019s supporters feel he doesn\u2019t deserve much. That became obvious on Thursday, when one prominent fan called for the removal of a Fabregas banner from the Ken Friar Bridge. Cesc Fabregas returns to Arsenal on Sunday and Arsene Wenger hopes fans will give him a good reception . Wenger wants 'respect' for the club's former players and counts Fabregas as a man who deserves that . Gunners fans offer their good luck to Fabregas in 2011, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time . Extreme, perhaps, but this is an emotive issue which continues to bubble away at the club where Fabregas built his career, not least because the circumstances behind his summer move from Barcelona to Chelsea are still as clear as mud. Any clarity, it seems, will have to wait. Wenger was at his cryptic best on Thursday when asked if it was his call to not take up an option he had to re-sign the player, saying: \u2018We will have to discuss that one day. With all the terms.\u2019 When pressed on whether it was his decision, he added: \u2018It\u2019s not as clean as that. I cannot speak to you about that now because that will not help us to win on Sunday.\u2019 At that point it was suggested to Wenger that Fabregas chose not to come back and Wenger said: \u2018I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u2019 The Frenchman has previously claimed that by the time he knew Fabregas was available, a deal with Chelsea was virtually concluded \u2014 comments which jarred a little with the Spaniard\u2019s statement last summer that Arsenal \u2018decided not to take\u2019 their option. Whatever, it would be ambitious for Fabregas to expect an overwhelmingly positive reception on Sunday. The midfielder set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Certainly, there was already a degree of disappointment within the club about how their relationship with the player ended when he left in 2011. But Wenger said: \u2018I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday, (I want him) to be respected like he deserves.\u2019 Wenger added: \u2018The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc\u2019s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here.\u2019 When he returns, it will be as a key part of the champions-elect and under a manager in Jose Mourinho who has won seven and drawn five of his 12 meetings with Wenger. That clash, in itself, is a fascinating sub-plot to this fixture between the top and second-placed teams in the Barclays Premier League. Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Playing down his poor record against Mourinho, Wenger said: \u2018We have not always lost, first of all, in 12 attempts. \u2018We have come close to beating them and they\u2019ve always had very strong teams. Having said all of that, the result on Sunday will be just down to the performance on the day. It\u2019s not a confrontation (with Mourinho), it\u2019s a confrontation of two teams. I\u2019m not a great believer in history. I just think football is down to the fact the performance on the day will decide the game and the result.\u2019 With seven straight league wins, Arsenal approach the fixture at speed, but Wenger accepts it is unlikely Chelsea will lose a 10-point advantage on the run-in. He said: \u2018We dropped points at the start of the season but since January we have been top of the (form) table. We want to continue to win and strengthen our position in second place because that\u2019s far from being done. 'Now what we can do is get closer to them and we have that opportunity. It still means even if we beat them, mathematically they are still in a very strong position. But you never know.\u2019",

    "source": "(CNN)There will be no hate crime charges for two males arrested in the beating of a man that may have been sparked by a question about the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. St. Louis police have charged Ronald Williams, 21, with assault.  A 15-year-old has also been arrested, according to authorities. There had been speculation that the suspects might be charged with a hate crime because the victim was white and the people who attacked him were black.  And because the punches were thrown following the Michael Brown reference. But that won't be happening. \"Specifically, when put in context, it did not support the finding that the acts in this case met the elements of the hate crime statute in the state of Missouri, specifically proving the motivating factor behind the individual that we have charged, Ed Postawko with the St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office told CNN affilaite KMOV. The beating, which occurred on a MetroLink light rail train, was caught on surveillance cameras and a passenger's cell phone camera. The passenger posted the video online, and it went viral. The victim, 43, said he was commuting home when a young black man asked to use the victim's cell phone. He declined, and the young man asked his opinion about the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager killed by a police officer in nearby Ferguson, Missouri, last summer, the man said. That shooting raised questions nationwide about use of deadly force by police. \"The next thing I know, he sucker punches me right in the middle of my face,\" the victim told CNN affiliate KMOV. The video showed a male unleashing a barrage of punches at the head of the victim, who covered himself with his hand and forearms. Two other males joined in, police said. The attackers fled. The man, who asked not to be identified, was treated at the scene for injuries and didn't go to the hospital.",

He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before Charlie Adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time. Stoke continued to make things difficult for Chelsea until an Asmir Begovic error led to Loic Remy tapping in the winner. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill gives his player ratings. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Thibaut Courtois \u2013 5.5 . Never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by Adam with an incredible strike from inside Stoke\u2019s half. Too far off his line and one of the world\u2019s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed. Thibaut Courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget  Charlie Adam beating him from his own half . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid . Branislav Ivanovic \u2013 6.5 . Tidied up well on the rare occasion Stoke threatened. Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill \u2013 6 .5 . Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry \u2013 7 . Manned the back well and it took a goal-of-the-season contender for his team to concede against a Stoke side that ran out of ideas at times. Always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat. Cesar Azpilicueta \u2013 6.5 . Tried to get forward and help Hazard down the left. Closed down well and put in a tireless performance. Nemanja Matic \u2013 6 . A few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for Chelsea. Cleaned up well when needed to win back possession, however. Cesc Fabregas \u2013 7 . Won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled Wollscheid. Kept the midfield ticking over well. Brazil international Willian (left) also produced an impressive display for Chelsea in the win over Stoke . Eden Hazard put Chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half . Diego Costa's (right) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury . Willian \u2013 7.5 . A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run. Oscar \u2013 6.5 . Scuppered one of Chelsea\u2019s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post, and was ultimately \u2013 and unfortunately \u2013 sacrificed for Costa at half time. Eden Hazard \u2013 8.5 . A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam\u2019s equaliser. Didn\u2019t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal. Loic Remy - 7.5 . Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved. Loic Remy (left) slots in Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . Diego Costa \u2013 6 . Came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury. Immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field. Didier Drogba \u2013 6 . Replaced Costa after the striker went off with an injury. Had little to do but hold up the ball. Juan Cuadrado \u2013 6 . Little to do but helped Chelsea get over the line. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho \u2013 6.5 . A frustrating afternoon for Mourinho, who was active on the touchline throughout, looking unhappy and muttering to himself. Either way, it worked, and his team added three points to their title charge. Jose Mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 . STOKE CITY (4-4-2) Asmir Begovic \u2013 6.5 . Outstanding one-handed save at full stretch to deny Remy\u2019s deflected shot after less than three minutes. Ultimately took a penalty for Begovic to concede the first. He\u2019d done his homework, going the same way Hazard normally does, but beaten at the other side. His throw was intercepted by Willian which led to Chelsea's winner, though. Geoff Cameron \u2013 5.5 . Given the unwanted task of stopping Hazard on his runs down the left wing on occasion. Ryan Shawcross \u2013 6 . Stayed physical throughout, as per. Captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously, but ultimately could not help them steal a point. Philipp Wollscheid \u2013 5.5 . Took the bait from Fabregas by sweeping the Spaniard\u2019s feet to give Chelsea a penalty and ultimately the lead. Ryan Shawcross (right) led Stoke well but could not help his side take a point at Stamford Bridge . Wollscheid (right) slides in on Cesc Fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half, from which Hazard scored . Marc Wilson \u2013 5.5 . A little unsure at times, largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team-mates. Stephen Ireland \u2013 6 . Strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue. Glenn Whelan \u2013 5.5 . Rightly booked for a late challenge on Fabregas but did not see much of the ball as Chelsea dominated midfield. Steven Nzonzi \u2013 6 . Close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by Matic and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal. Could not take the few chances that fell his way. Steven Nzonzi (centre) went close to scoring for Stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game . Charlie Adam (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores . Charlie Adam \u2013 6.5 . Take a bow, Charlie Adam. Incredible goal as he channelled his inner David Beckham and, noticing Courtois off his line, scored from in his own half. A little anonymous until that moment, but his faults were obliterated with that 66-yard strike. Jonathan Walters \u2013 5.5 . Little joy as Stoke rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion. Closely marked by Terry throughout. Mame Biram Diouf \u2013 5.5 . Failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for Arnautovic. Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work . Mame Biram Diouf (left) floundered against Chelsea's stern defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . SUBS: . Arnautovic \u2013 6 . Too little too late to have an influence. MANAGER: Mark Hughes 5.5 . His team were constantly on the backfoot. REFEREE: Jonathan Moss 6 . Correct decision with the penalty. Not many controversial decisions to make aside from that, but had to be strict with bookings .",

    "source": "Two of England\u2019s most ambitious and well-resourced academies go head-to-head on Monday night as Manchester City play Chelsea in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final. Both teams are packed with talented players eager to make an impression in front of the TV cameras and stake their claim for first-team involvement in the seasons to come. Ahead of the match at City\u2019s Academy Stadium we tell you everything you need to know. Dominic Solanke (second right) scores for Chelsea against Shakhtar Donetsk in the UEFA Youth League final . WHAT\u2019S THE OCCASION? It\u2019s the first leg of the FA Youth Cup final and it\u2019ll take place at City\u2019s 7,200-capacity Academy Stadium, in the shadow of the main Etihad Stadium and part of their \u00a3200m Etihad Campus that opened last year. The match kicks off at 7.45pm and will be shown live on ITV4. The second leg takes place next Monday at Stamford Bridge. HOW DID THE TEAMS GET THERE? City started their campaign with a 2-0 win over Oxford United in the third round just before Christmas, with goals from Marcus Wood and Bersant Celina sealing a comfortable win. Jason Wilcox\u2019s team really had their shooting boots on in the fourth round, thrashing Coventry City 8-2. Brandon Barker was the star with three of them, while Thierry Ambrose (2), Pablo Maffeo, Javairo Dilrosun and Denzeil Boadu also cashed in. Man City's Thierry Ambrose (centre) scores his second goal during the 8-2 victory over Coventry . Manchester City's Isaac Buckley Ricketts (left) celebrates scoring during the semi-final against Leicester . It wasn\u2019t as straightforward in the next round, with a solitary Celina strike beating Stoke City, but City were back to their free-scoring best in beating Crewe Alexandra 6-1 in the last eight. Having fallen behind early on, City stormed back to win thanks to goals from Aaron Nemane, Barker (2), Boadu, Celina and Ambrose. That set up a two-legged semi-final with Leicester City and they were very keen to get the job done, winning the home first leg 3-0. Nemane (2) and Boadu continued their scoring form. The second leg at the King Power Stadium was a formality and, having fallen behind to a second-half penalty, two goals in stoppage time from Isaac Buckley and Barker sealed a 5-1 aggregate win. Chelsea started their campaign at the beginning of December and were drawn away to Leeds United. An Izzy Brown penalty and a late second from Dominic Solanke got the Blues Youth Cup defence underway. Huddersfield Town were beaten 6-1 in the fourth round, with England under 18 star Solanke scoring a hat-trick. Tammy Abraham grabbed two and Kasey Palmer rounded off an emphatic win. And Joe Edwards\u2019 team went goal crazy again in the fifth round, beating Swansea 6-0. This time it was Abraham scoring a treble and Solanke adding two. Palmer also got on the scoresheet. A tough trip to Newcastle United followed but the Blues finally prevailed in extra time with Brown, Solanke and Abraham on the scoresheet in a 3-0 win at St James\u2019 Park. That set up a tasty semi-final tie with Tottenham and all seemed lost when Spurs took a 2-0 lead from the first leg at White Hart Lane. Chelsea were to fall further behind in the second leg at Stamford Bridge but mounted an extraordinary fightback. Izzy Brown (centre) scores for Cheslea against Tottenham as they staged a thrilling comeback last month . Goals from Solanke and Brown gave them hope before the break, before two in two minutes from Solanke and Charlie Colkett just after turned the game on its head. A Colkett penalty then put daylight between the teams as Chelsea won a thrilling tie 5-4 on aggregate. YOUTH CUP PEDIGREE . Manchester City have twice lifted the FA Youth Cup - in 1986 and 2008. The last of those saw them defeat Chelsea 3-1 at the Etihad after a 1-1 draw in London. Slovakian Vladimir Weiss was the star performer. He went on to make just five first-team appearances for City and now plays, aged 25, for Lekhwiya in the Qatari Stars League. Chelsea have made the competition their own in recent years and this is their fifth final in six seasons. Their wins in 2010, 2012 and 2014 added to earlier successes in 1960 and 1961. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? City coach Jason Wilcox: \u2018Our job is to recruit local lads. If we can get a group of Manchester-born lads into the first team then that's the ideal scenario. To do that is going to be really difficult but that's the challenge. We don't want local lads playing for Tottenham, Arsenal or Chelsea. It\u2019s up to us to make sure that, via the scouting, we have at least the opportunity of showing them our programme. I\u2019m convinced once they see us it\u2019s very difficult to walk away from.\u2019 Chelsea coach Joe Edwards: \u2018Winning breeds confidence so to have a group of players coming back for this game who were crowned European champions last week [when the Under-19s won the UEFA Youth League] is a massive plus for us. Once you get a taste of winning, you want that feeling again and again.\u2019 PLAYERS TO WATCH . MANCHESTER CITY . Brandon Barker - speedy winger who has been on the books at City\u2019s academy since the age of eight. The Manchester-born teenager made a positive impression with 13 goals for the under 18s last season and has since progressed into Patrick Vieira\u2019s Elite Development Squad. Has scored six time on the Youth Cup run and is an England under 19 international. Brandon Barker is an England Under 19 international and scored 13 goals for City's under 18s last season . Thierry Ambrose - capable of playing anywhere across the forward line, Ambrose was signed from Auxerre\u2019s youth teams in 2013. Impressed in his first season with the under 18s, scoring 22 goals in 32 matches, enough to earn the Parisian a place in the EDS team. Has scored three times during City\u2019s Youth Cup run. Ambrose (centre) scored 22 goals in 32 matches for City's under 18s after signing from Auxerre . Aaron Nemane - another who has scored three times during the Youth Cup run. Right winger Nemane made his debut for the City under 18 side at just 14 and made quite an impact by scoring twice. Has played mainly in the under 18 team but did travel to Croatia with the EDS squad last pre-season. Aaron Nemane (right) made his debut for Manchester City's under 18 side aged just 14 . CHELSEA . Dominic Solanke - enjoying an extraordinary season and hoping to win the Youth Cup for the second successive season having scored two goals in the last five minutes to sink Fulham last year. With 34 goals for Chelsea this season, he inspired them to UEFA Youth League success a week ago having scored in every round. Should he score in the final, he will also have scored in each round of the Youth Cup. England under 18 international. Solanke (left) has been in prolific form for Chelsea both at home and abroad this season . Jay Dasilva - earned rave reviews for his performances in the Youth League, with Ian Wright suggesting he was already better than any left-back in the Premier League. Still only 16, his mature performance have seen him already established in the under 21 team. Jay Dasilva has impressed for Chelsea at left-back and is a regular for the Under 21 team . Charlie Colkett - captain of the side and an important figure in the Chelsea midfield. Will set the tempo and drive the team forward with direct runs and intelligent passes. Very impressive all season, especially on the continental stage. Charle Colkett (right) is captain of Chelsea's youth cup side and has impressed all season .",

    "source": "Comedian Sarah Silverman is encouraging women to understand their worth and ask for equal pay in a new campaign in which she recounts a time she was discriminated against because of her gender. The 44-year-old, who is known for her wicked sense of humor, gets serious for Levo League's Ask4More\u00a0campaign, which calls for women to request the salaries that they deserve in honor of Equal Pay Day on April 14. 'I think the best person for the job should get jobs,' she says in the campaign video.\u00a0'I'm all for women having to work harder to prove themselves at this juncture if that's the way it is in the world. But if you work a job, and a man is working the same job, you should be getting paid the same.' Scroll down for video . Be confident: Sarah Silverman wants women to understand their worth as a part of Levo League's new\u00a0Ask4More campaign, which encourages women to request the salaries that they deserve . On average, women only earn 78 cents for every dollar made by men, and in the clip, the actress recalls a time when she was faced with an even worse pay margin because of her gender. Sarah explains that she and fellow comedian Todd Barry were doing back-to-back stand up sets on a Saturday night at the New York Comedy Club. Even though she says she was 'pretty well known at the time', she 'didn't think anything of it' when she was given $10 for her work. But when she was chatting with Todd outside, it soon came up that he was offered $60 for the same amount of work - at the same show. When she went back inside and asked Al Martin, the owner at the time, about the pay discrepancy, he thought that she was asking him to lend her money, saying: 'Oh, did you want a $60 spot?' Not right: In the video, Sarah recalls a time when she was paid $10 to do a stand-up routine, when a man who performed the same amount of time earned $60 . 'It was symbolic. I didn't need $60,' she says of that moment. 'You know, it\u2019s pretty sh****.' Sarah, who came under fire last month after she tweeted 'ten rape prevention tips' aimed at male attackers, says whenever she shares anything 'women's rights related' on social media, including equal pay and health care, she gets 'the most violent hate tweets back'. 'It's so odd. It's just bizarre,' she says. Sarah explains that knowing your self-worth is a big factor when it comes to women feeling confident to ask for more. 'My therapist says - and I think about it all the time - we don't get what we want. We get what we think we deserve,' she added. Double standard: The 44-year-old comedian, who is pictured at the\u00a02015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, says she gets 'the most violent hate tweets' when she discusses women's issues on Twitter . Sports fan: Sarah, who often plays basketball with men, was pictured with Anthony Anderson as they watched Sprite NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in New York City in February . She notes that the concept of asking for more and understanding your worth reminds of her of how she feels when she plays basketball with men. 'Every basket you miss is like missing 100 baskets and that comes from inside.' Sarah says she reminds herself that she isn't letting her team down, nor or the guys angry at her for missing a shot. The pressure she feels is being brought upon by herself. She explains that she finally realized that 'the guys shoot and miss all the time - most of the time - and they get better. 'We deserve quality lives with equality, and maybe control over our own human bodies without the government getting involved, to do whatever we get great at and do, and it has to come from inside and understanding that you deserve it and working to deserve it,' she says, before adding: \u2018Go ahead. Ask for more.' Sarah is a part of the nine-day campaign, which aims to empower women throughout their careers and includes other female celebrity supporters such as Amy Poehler, Chelsea Clinton and Constance Zimmer.",

Rachel Sandridge, 29, from Maryland, says she was shocked at the unexpected diagnosis but thankful to her diligent doctor. Sandridge was due to undergo the surgery after her weight reached 430lbs. Rachel Sandridge, 29, from Maryland, was due to undergo the surgery after her weight reached 430 pounds.. but durring the prep her doctor discovered she had cancer. Pictured: Sandridge (left) before surgery and after . She had to lose weight to qualify for the surgery and then underwent a routine endoscopy, to examine her digestive tract to ensure it was all healthy. But it was during the procedure her doctor was concerned at signs of inflammation and took a biopsy to sample. Sandridge was then told cancer had been found in her stomach. The cancer diagnosis was even more devastating as only two years earlier her father has died from cancer. Pictured, at his funeral in 2012 . Sandridge before the operation. She is now cancer-free and has dropped her weight from about 430lbs to about 288lbs, including about 50lbs before her gastric bypass . Stomach cancer is a relatively rare form of the disease, with fewer than 25,000 cases annually in the US. The early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other, less serious conditions. They include: persistent indigestion and heartburn, trapped wind and frequent burping, feeling very full or bloated after meals, persistent stomach pain . As the disease develops, more advanced symptoms include: blood in your stools, or black stools loss of appetite weight loss . In many cases, due to the face the early symptoms are so similar to other conditions, the disease is often advanced by the time it is detected. It is vital people suffering the early symptoms get checked by their doctor as soon as possible. There are different types of stomach cancer - 95 per cent of cases develop in the cells of the stomach lining - known as adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Less common forms of the disease include lymphoma of the stomach, which develops in the lymphatic tissue and gastrointestinal stromal tumours, which develop in the muscle of the stomach wall. Around 15 per cent of stomach cancer patients live at least five years after diagnosis, and around 11 per cent live for 10 years. Source: NHS Choices . Stomach cancer is a relatively rare form of the disease, with fewer than 25,000 cases annually in the US. The early symptoms are vague and easy to mistake for other, less serious conditions. 'It didn't fully click. I was scared and really nervous,' Sandridge told ABC. The news was even more devastating as only two years earlier her father has died from cancer. 'I know the toll it puts on you,' Sandridge said. She underwent a second during which the tumor itself and further cells were scrapped. The tumor was reviewed and Sandridge was told the cancer had been caught at an early state and it had not spread through the muscle wall. Sandridge did not need any chemotherapy or radiation and is now cancer-free. She has dropped her 10 dress sizes and weighs about 288lbs, and has more energy than before. Sandridge has had to adjust her diet following the operation as gastric bypass is a major surgical procedure, which changes eating and dietary habits dramatically. After surgery, the patients can no longer hold large quantities of food, but need to eat smaller amounts at regular intervals. The patients also need to eat in a different way as foods rich in fat, sugar and fibre may cause discomfort in the smaller stomach. 'If I'd not gone through with the [weight loss] surgery when I did, things would be 100 percent different,' she said to the Baltimore Sun. 'My cancer would have probably spread and it would have been too late to have had anything done about it.'",

    "source": "Johnny Depp has one of the most distinctive faces in Hollywood, but he's almost unrecognizable in the first trailer for his latest film Black Mass. In the long-awaited trailer for the film to be released this September, Depp plays James 'White' Bulger - the notorious Boston gangster who topped the FBI's most wanted list for 16 years before he was finally arrested in 2011. The trailer was one of several Warner Bros screen at CinemaCon on Thursday, and the creepy two-minute clip was a highlight of the day. Scroll down for video . American gangster: The first trailer for the upcoming biopic on the life of Boston gangster James 'Whitey' Bulger was released Thursday. Johnny Depp plays the notorious criminal in the film . Unrecognizable: In the trailer, Depp is completely transformed for the role. \u00a0He looks several years older, with grey slicked back hair and his brown eyes changes to a grey-blue. Bulger pictured in a 1973 mugshot, right . With thinning blond hair slicked back meticulously, disarming grayish blue eyes, and speckled, pink skin, 51-year-old Depp is transformed into a menacing presence in the generation-spanning story about the alliance between Bulger and the FBI. 'This is a film about the abuse of power,' said director Scott Cooper. 'In the city of Boston at this time, criminals and lawmen were virtually indistinguishable.' Depp, he said, gives a 'performance for the ages.' The trailer opens up to Depp eating dinner and complimenting the host and asking about the marinade. The host, played by actor David Harbour, initially tells Depp it's a family secret but eventually caves and spills the recipe. Dinner talk: The chilling clip begins with a friendly Depp complimenting his host, played by David Harbour (far right), on the steak they're eating . Daggers: When Harbour quickly gives up the 'family secret' recipe, Depp turns cold and goes into a lecture on spilling secrets . Most wanted: The rest of the trailer shows flashbacks of Bulger's darkside: carrying out hits and womanizing . Killer: Depp stands threateningly over a man in this clips previewed in Thursday's new trailer . Evil laugh: Depp eventually breaks the scary silence over the table and breaks out into an unsettling cackle . That's when Depp turns serious and goes on a chilling monologue about the importance of keeping secrets. 'I was just say-' a nervous Harbour answers before Depp cuts him off. 'Just sayin' gets people sent away. Just sayin' got me a nine-year stretch in Alcatraz, you understand? So just sayin' can get you buried will quick,' Depp says. A silence falls over the table for several seconds, before Depp breaks out in an unsettling cackle. On set: Depp is pictured above filming Black Mass last July, along with co-star Peter Sarsgaard (right) The crime drama is based on the 2001 book Black Mass: The True Story Of An Unholy Alliance Between The FBI And The Irish Mob written by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. The film also stars Joel Edgerton, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Peter Sarsgaard and Dakota Johnson. Bulger had a long career of run-ins with the law, dating all the way back to when he was just 14 years old. In the early 70s, after spending nine years in prison for armed robbery and truck hijacking, Bulger returned to Boston and joined a prominent Irish mob in South Boston. As he became climbed up the rankings of the mob, Bulger was recruited in the mid 1970s to become an informant for the FBI, supplying the bureau with information on a rival crime family. Then in 1997, Bulger was outed as an informant in newspaper reports and he went on the run when his own handler said he was about to be hit with an indictment. Captured: Bulger pictured on the left in 2011, after he was finally arrested after 16 years on the run. He is currently imprisoned in a maximum security prison in Florida. Depp on the right . Starting young: Bulger's criminal history stretches all the way back to when he was just 14 years old and a part of a Boston street gang . For the next 16 years, Bulger evaded law enforcement until he was finally caught on June 22, 2011 at a Santa Monica, California apartment he shared with his longtime girlfriend. He went on trial two years later on 32 counts of racketeering, money laundering, extortion, weapons charges, and ties to 19 murders. He was found guilty on 31 of those charges in August and sentenced to two consecutive life in prison sentences in November 2013.

    "source": "Looking after a newborn baby is one of the most exhausting periods in a woman's life. You haven't recovered from giving birth and are suddenly on duty 24/7, responsible for entertaining, feeding and cleaning an unstoppable machine. On top of this, the mothers have to deal with the never-ending conveyor belt of friends and family who are desperate to see the new addition. Looking after a newborn is one of the most exhausting periods in life (picture posed by model) Well-meaning visitors arrive at the house armed with gifts for the baby and plenty of compliments. But while they might be well-intentioned, there are a number of pitfalls to be avoided when cooing over a newborn. Parenting blogger\u00a0Emily-Jane Clark, who runs the popular site\u00a0How to Survive a Sleep Thief, which she describes as\u00a0'an antithesis to baby advice',\u00a0has compiled a list of the ways that visitors can avoid annoying a new mother. They include bringing gifts for the mum and coming armed with chocolate and coffee - read on to find out more... New mothers receive plenty of visitors shorty after giving birth, who often have annoying habits\u00a0(picture posed by model) 1. DO NOT arrive unannounced to \u2018give us a break from the baby\u2019. Emily-Jane says: 'We have known our child for two days. We do not need a break from her just yet. 'Give me a week or two and no doubt I\u2019ll be begging for you to take her off my hands!' 2. DO buy presents for ME! Not for the baby. Emily-Jane says: 'I\u2019m the one with the stitched up lady bits who did all the hard work. My daughter has spent the past ten months sitting on her arse. My need for gifts is greater than hers. 'Besides, all she cares about right now is milky breasts. So unless you can supply some of those then you really needn\u2019t bother. 'And what\u2019s with all the muslins? In no other situation would it be deemed acceptable to buy someone just out of hospital cleaning cloths as a  present. Not to mention the ultimate insult. I can barely bring myself to type the words. NON-alcoholic \u2018champagne\u2019. Sparkling bloody grape juice! 'I have just endured ten months of pregnancy and hours of labour. Do you not think I might need a proper drink? Sure, I am breastfeeding, but I can still have one glass (yes, I checked, by god, did I check).' Mothers are often on the brink of exhaustion when looking after a newborn\u00a0(picture posed by model) 3. DO wash your hands before you touch my baby. Emily-Jane says: 'You may think you have clean hands until you meet the first time mother of a newborn. 'The brand new mum is highly adept in detecting dirt invisible to the naked eye. She is well aware that on every square centimetre of your hand there are 1,500 bacteria. 'And the moment you touch her baby\u2019s face or, god forbid, let the baby suck your finger (why?) \u2013 she can see all 50,000 of those germy little tossers wriggling off your hand and into her baby\u2019s brand new little mouth.' 4. DO give support not advice. Emily-Jane says: 'I might tell you I am finding motherhood tough. I may say I feel out of my depth. But do not take this to mean I need you to tell me how to feed/hold/change my baby. 'Thanks to the Internet, parenting books and the NHS, my head is filled with so much advice that I am already struggling to listen to my maternal instincts. 'So offer a shoulder to cry on, or a sympathetic ear, but please, no unsolicited advice.' Mothers often get a stream of visitors in the months after giving birth\u00a0(picture posed by model) 5. DO NOT tell me that my baby looks just like her father. Emily-Jane says: 'She doesn\u2019t. She currently looks like a wrinkly, blotchy newborn. Seriously, if my husband really did look like a two-day-old baby I don\u2019t think I would have married him.' 6. DO NOT gender stereo-type my child. Emily-Jane says: 'Just because I have a girlbaby it does not mean I want to dress her up like a princess or fill her room with princesses. 7. DO NOT enter my home unless you are armed with coffee and or/chocolate. 8. DO NOT ask me questions about the future. Emily-Jane says: 'Will you be getting her christened? When will she go in her own room? Will you be going to the NCT baby group? Where will she go to school? 'Right now, I can barely work out what I am doing tomorrow, let alone in three years\u2019 time.'",

But second children are left to rely on hand-me-downs, with around \u00a3500 less spent on them in their first year of life. More than a third of mothers clothed their second baby in one or more hand-me-downs, with 46 per cent giving them toys bought for their elder sibling. Second children are left with hand-me-downs, and around \u00a3500 less spent on them in their first year of life . And though 82 per cent have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair or a video of their first steps, only 23 per cent have a keepsake for their second, a report by Debenhams found. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows. Doubtless the latest addition to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's family, due next week, won't have to put up with many hand-me-downs, but he, or she, will be a baby that bucks the trend, says the new study. The report for the high street retailer found on average the second born has over \u00a3500 less spent on them in the first 12 months, than the first sibling who is showered with attention and given the best of everything. Second children have to put up with having fewer new clothes bought for then as well as having a poorer record of their upbringing, with noticeably fewer photos and home movies taken of their young life. It happened with Prince William and Prince Harry as babies. The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother. Prince Willam and Prince Harry:\u00a0The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother . Over eight out of ten mums (82%) say they have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair, a video of the first step, or the first drawing while less than one in four (23%) have a keepsake of their second. A third (32%) of second time mums admit to clothing their new baby in one or more hand-me-downs and almost half (46%) say they give them toys which had been brought originally for the elder brother or sister. Mums confess to wasting money on the first born due to, 'inexperience', and the, 'excitement' of a first baby, but also report a sharp decline in gifts for the second- born. They also say they are more knowledgeable about toddlers' demands when it comes to subsequent children and realise they don't need so much. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows . Four of five mums say they bought, or were given, more expensive items than were required when their first child came along. Designer outfits promoted by fashion loving celebrities were rated as the biggest luxury with only 12% of second children being bought clothing with a designer label compared with 38% of first-borns. More than half of first-time mums also admitted to splashing out on clothes their children have never worn. First children have on average 14 cuddly toys by the age of six months, whereas the later child makes do with an average of eight. Mums said they asked friends and relatives for specific practical gifts for the second child rather than relying on chance, which cut down on presents that were never used. When asked about family albums of their children up to the age of two, three quarters admit that those photos almost always include the older sibling. It was only when a toddler started nursery school that the second child started having more photos taken. Debenhams head of childrenswear, Shani Delargy said: 'Having a baby at any time is a momentous experience but it's understandable that mums adopt a much more practical approach by the time the second child comes along. 'Whilst mothers want the best for all their children. It's all about being sensible and looking for good value products. At Debenhams we recognise this and offer a great choice of baby products and clothing for all budgets, including designer labels at high street prices.' According to the Office for National Statistics the average age to have a second child is 30.1 years, while the average age of first time mothers is 28.1 years old. The Duchess of Cambridge was 31 when Prince George was born and is now aged 33. And though 82 per cent have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair or a video of their first steps, only 23 per cent have a keepsake for their second, a report by Debenhams found .",

    "source": "Liverpool must stick with manager Brendan Rodgers as he is the right man to take the club forward, believes former Reds' striker Stan Collymore. Rodgers has come under-fire following a disappointing third season with the Anfield outfit - which has led to some unhappy fans calling for his dismissal. Not since the 1950 has a previous Liverpool manager  gone three campaigns without a trophy, but that is the unwanted fate that will meet the 42-year-old at the end of this term. Liverpool must keep faith with under-fire manager Brendan Rodgers, believes ex-Kop striker Stan Collymore . The Reds' FA Cup semi-final exit against Aston Villa on Sunday followed defeat at the same stage of the Capital One Cup by Chelsea. A season of false hope was compounded further as the club failed to progress past the Champions League group stages and were then dumped out of the Europa League on penalties. To make for a gloomier outlook, the Merseysiders' hopes of a top four spot seem remote - as they trail fourth-placed Manchester City by seven points with six games remaining. Liverpool's fortunes are in stark contrast to last season when they came agonisingly close to being crowned champions of England for the first time since 1990. And speaking on TalkSPORT, Collymore is adamant that Rodgers is still the correct figure to make the Reds a force to be reckoned with once more. 'I believe Liverpool should have patience with Brendan Rodgers,' \u00a0the Kick Off host said. Rodgers (right) saw his team dumped out of the FA Cup semi-finals by Aston Villa at Wembley on Sunday . 'The reasons are quite simple: He is a very good coach, he has a proven track record - going back to Chelsea under Jose Mourinho - of promoting youth, developing youth and giving them an opportunity. 'What he didn't have, having been at two smaller clubs in Swansea City and Reading, is a track record of spending big money, which he needs to do to take Liverpool onto the next level. 'But, he took Liverpool to two semi-finals this season and they were within a whisker of winning the Premier League title for the first time ever last season. 'So, for me, Brendan Rodgers is the right man.' Fabian Delph (centre) scored the matchwinning goal  as  Villa condemned Liverpool to a 2-1 defeat on Sunday .",

Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg. In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself. Doctors tried in vain to save Mr Sithole's life. His cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket . Attack:\u00a0Shocking images capture the moment the armed gang surround Emmanuel Sithole and repeatedly stab him with knives and bludgeon him with a wrench in Alexandra township near Johannesburg . Sick: As Emmanuel Sithole lay injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench . The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight. But as children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench. As Mr Sithole sat injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench. A third attacker - wearing a grey hoodie - then reportedly entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife. Before he had the chance to use the knife a witness intervened and the three men fled the scene. It was too late for Mr Sithole, however, who managed to stumble along the road pleading for help for his fatal injuries before collapsing fatally injured in a rubbish-strewn gutter. Under siege:\u00a0The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight . Beaten: As children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was brutally attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench . Savage: Another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab Emmanuel Sithole repeatedly . Witnesses, including the  journalist, took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township. During the subsequent journey to a hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed and winced in agony before he eventually fell unconscious. Porters initially refused to take the man into the hospital as he appeared to be dead but, after spotting him choking he was rushed inside the building where doctors tried in vain to save his life. The cause of death was later established as a direct stab wound to the heart and his identity established from a mobile phone found in his pocket. Following the attack, fearful immigrants in South Africa revealed they had been targeted  by longtime neighbors and people who warned they would assault anyone carrying a foreign passport. The immigrants spoke at a tent camp where they are now living having fled Alexandra when the mobs began attacking shops owned by those from other African countries. Harrowing: A third attacker  then entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife . Brave: Before the man had the chance to use the large knife, a witness intervened and the three attackers fled the scene . The violence in Alexandra township followed anti-immigrant riots in and around the coastal city of Durban that killed at least six people, recalling a bout of similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which about 60 people died. The message from the mobs in Alexandra was, 'We don't want to see people with passports. We only want to see people with South African IDs,' said Veronica Lechaea, who comes from the southern African country of Lesotho and has lived in South Africa since 2008. Lechaea, who works as an office cleaner in Johannesburg, left her home in Alexandra and sought refuge in a camp set up on the grounds of an Anglican church by the charity Gift of the Givers. She said she makes about $250 a month and sends half of the money home to Lesotho to support her 12-year-old son, who is living there with his grandparents. The attacks stem from a perception that immigrants are taking jobs at the expense of South Africans in a country with high unemployment. Many people from other countries have entered South Africa illegally, though the government has said a large number are working legally and contributing to economic development. Some African countries are arranging to repatriate their fearful citizens, and there have been protests and calls in Malawi, Zimbabwe and other regional nations for a boycott of South African goods. Dying: Witnesses took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township . Fatally wounded:\u00a0In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because the a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself . During the subsequent journey to hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed in agony before eventually falling unconscious . South Africa has one of the biggest economies in Africa and it is unclear whether any boycott would have a significant impact. Immigrants from Asia and the Middle East have also been affected by the violence in South Africa. Sandra Ngwanya, a chicken seller from Zimbabwe who also left her Alexandra home for the Gift of the Givers camp, said her neighbors told her: ''We are going to go door to door, taking your stuff and beating you. So we want you to go back to your country.'' Ngwanya, who has lived in South Africa since 2006 and married a South African, said she left her two young children with cousins and hoped to go home soon. 'They are saying it's quiet. The police are all over the place. I want to go and check on our stuff,' said Ngwanya, whose husband works in a mine outside Johannesburg and planned to return to check on his family. However, some people at the camp said the situation remained volatile.",

Grey and white cat Marv somehow managed to get wedged in a five inch gap in between owner Brendon Veale's garage and his neighbours in Hanham, Bristol and was left dangling for two hours. The RSPCA were called and they too were unable to coax the pet from the gap and eventually firefighters had to tunnel through a garage wall with a chisel to get him free. Scroll down for video . Grey and white cat Marv was left hanging for upside for over two hours and the RSPCA were unable to coax him out . Marv was shaken by his ordeal but uninjured and was eventually reunited with Mr Veale's two daughters Tilly and Bella. The rescue unfolded last Wednesday when a neighbour heard miaowing coming from the side of his garage. RSPCA animal welfare officer Simon Coombs tried to free the puss, but he was so tightly wedged in that he couldn't move him, and called Avon Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters spent half an hour chiselling a breezeblock free from the neighbour's wall, revealing Marv's tail and back legs so Mr Coombs could pull him out backwards. Firefighters were then called and they were forced to chisel through the wall in order to free Marv, who was stuck . After creating a hole in the wall, Marv's tail and back legs were revealed and an RSPCA officer pulled him free . Marv the cat became stuck in a small gap in between two garages next to his owner's house in Hanham, Bristol . He said: 'We don't know how Marv got into the space, it may be that he fell into the gap and struggled to get free only to get himself well and truly stuck. 'As usual, we are immensely grateful to the fire and rescue service for their help, not to mention grateful to the neighbour, whose garage wall came off the worst in this incident! 'It was great to see Marv reunited with his family after this real team effort to free him.' While owner Mr Veale, a mortgage broker, added: 'My neighbour came round to tell me he thought the cat was stuck. 'He was crying out quite a bit and he was too far stuck down to get out, and also upside down, so he couldn't hold on to anything. He was eventually reunited with his owner's daughters Tilly and Bella and luckily he was uninjured .

'When they broke through he didn't have much choice in the matter, and he did cry a bit, but he was reasonably calm and was just stressed out for a few days.

This is also prime territory for a gallery\u00ad lover like me: the beautiful, elegant and not-\u00adtoo-\u00adbig Mauritshuis was restored last year. This is also the home of Girl With A Pearl Earring, the 'Dutch Mona Lisa'. But I am not only here for the Vermeer, Rembrandt and Hals. Much more than a village: The Parliament Building stands proud in The Hague - a hidden gem of a city . There is the Escher gallery (devoted to that geometry-\u00addefying genius), the contemporary art Gemeentemuseum and more. Meanwhile, I am being charmed by an unsuspected delight: this medieval city by the sea. 'City? This is Europe's biggest village,' says my guide, Remco D\u00f6rr. He is right: The Hague, despite being home to Holland's royal family and an eye-\u00adcatching parliament, was classed as a village until Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon's brother and king of Holland) set up here in 1806. It has a genteel moat/canal, which encircles the historic centre. We step across and in front of an approaching car, which slows down deferentially. Remco tells me that many traffic lights have been taken out for aesthetic reasons. 'Now, the cars are very careful,' he says. The Hague is home to one of the cornerstones of European art - Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring . You have to love that kind of Dutch logic - though it doesn't seem to apply to cyclists, who rule the place. Next time, I will rent a bicycle, although the trams and buses are easy and cheap (an all-day pass costs \u20ac7.70/\u00a35.60). Over the moat, we are in Noordeinde street. Remco ushers me into what used to be part of a palace, and still has huge chandeliers and ornate mirrors. This cobbled part of town is home to private galleries and unassuming cafes (I snacked in the Juni Lekkernijen), as well as altogether more assuming ones. HanTing is the latest Michelin star in town and the best place for Indonesian cuisine. The most prized Dutch colony was apparently run from The Hague (aka 'the Widow of Indonesia'). For summer: the excellent Grapes & Olives and the Caf\u00e9 de Bieb on Veenkade will have boats on a newly renovated bit of canal, with music and boat trips planned, including a tour at the Kompaan brewery (I can vouch for the product). My art gorging finishes at the Panorama, an extraordinary, 14 ft-\u00adhigh circular panorama of The Hague's seaside resort, Scheveningen, painted by Hendrik Mesdag. I take a 15-minute tram to the place itself and gorge on scallops and sole at Catch by Simonis on the harbour front. The Hague has netted a new fan. British\u00a0Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Rotterdam Den Haag (half-hour taxi) from \u00a3100 return. For tours with Remco D\u00f6rr, email remco.dorr@\u00adhotmail.com. Double rooms at the Carlton Ambassador (00 31 70 363 0363, www.carlton.nl/\u00adambassador) cost from \u00a384, room only. More information on travel in The Netherlands at www.holland.com.",

The Kardashians fended off swooning fans as they entered the Saint James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official, said the family had arrived for a baptism ceremony. Scroll down for video . Surprise stop:\u00a0Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and North West arrived in Jerusalem on Monday for North's baptism . Special visit: Kanye and North at the Armenian St. James Cathedral in Jerusalem's Old City . Sacrament: Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, an Armenian church official, confirmed North's baptism . VIP treatment: The family were escorted out of the church by a priest . Tight security: The group were surrounded by guards . No heels today: Kim wore sensible flat sandals for the ceremony . 'Kim Kardashian's daughter will be baptized and become a Christian officially and a member of the Armenian church,' Shirvanian said, slightly perplexed by all the commotion. 'All I know is that she's a famous personality. I don't know her in person. In any case she is welcome with her family.' A source tells E! that Khloe, who attended the ceremony wearing sneakers and ripped jeans, is North's godmother while the priest acted as her godfather (while uncommon, it is an option where there isn't one). The insider described the ceremony as 'so special'. The 22-month-old was dressed in a white gown and her father was wearing the same colour. Kim opted for a striped wrap-around dress and flat sandals. Afterwards, the family dined with Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat at Mona Restaurant. Members of reality TV's first family touched down Monday in the Holy Land for what was described as a private two-day visit. They family had earlier arrived in a private jet at Israel's international airport before being whisked away in a dark black SUV to a hotel in Jerusalem. Protective dad: The rapper left the church after the ceremony with his daughter in two . Taking in the sights: The group explored the historic church . Holy Land visit: The family are in Jerusalem for what was described as a private two-day visit . Family affair: Khloe Kardashian was joined in the trip . Cuddles with mom: The reality star carried her daughter into the church . All were captured on camera disembarking their plane and the images featured prominently on Israeli websites. The Kardashian entourage arrived from a high-profile visit to Armenia, where the Kardashian family traces its roots. They are expected to shoot some footage for their reality show in Jerusalem before moving on to Jordan. Reality TV royalty: The star gave fans a regal wave . The family's Armenian tour certainly ended in spectacular fashion after Kanye gave a surprise free performance in the capital city, Yerevan, on Sunday night. He had to be rescued by security after being mobbed by fans in Swan Lake. Things got hectic when 'thousands' of fans followed his lead and waded into the water. Before striding into the shallow lake, he told the assembled crowd: 'Over there, can y'all see me over there? We're going to do something different right now, like, like, like we always do it this time!' Not too close! Kanye tried to keep the crowd at bay . As paparazzi scrambled to get a picture, security guards pulled Kanye out from the group of fans and police stopped the gig - which was being live streamed - from continuing. However, despite the abrupt ending to the set, which lasted just six songs, he and Kim appeared to have enjoyed the mayhem. His wife tweeted afterwards: 'Crazy night! Kanye wakes me up & says he's doing a free concert in Yerevan, Armenia! I throw on sweats & we go! Thousands of people were there! Kanye jumped in swan lake to be closer to the crowd on the other side & so many people jumped in too! Such an exciting crazy night! So happy I got to rock out with everyone in Armenia on our last night here!!!! #EpicNight #ArmenianPride (sic)' Baby and Yeezus: Kanye doted over his only child . Back on daddy duty: The rapper performed a surprise concert in Armenia on Sunday to mark the end of their trip . Quick visit: The family are expected to leave Israel on Tuesday . The 34-year-old - whose late father Robert Kardashian was of Armenian-American descent - later took to Twitter again to thank everyone who came out to see her husband perform, and said she was going to miss the country. Kim tweeted: 'I've learned on this trip how many talented Armenian musicians we have! What an incredible night!!!! Going to miss it here!!! Thank you to everyone who came out last night to see Kanye perform!' The reality TV star's Armenia trip had been very well-documented on the social media website, as she posted pictures of her, her sister Khloe, and cousins Kourtni and Kara, meeting the Armenian Prime Minister, as well as the two sisters having an 'emotional day' at the Genocide Museum - which they were visiting for a documentary they're filming about the Armenian Genocide. Kim tweeted: 'It was an honour to meet the Prime Minister of Armenia, Hovik Abrahamyan. He expressed how proud they are that we are proud Armenians and we have not forgotten our roots. #NeverForget'.

    "source": "Gerry Adams has sparked outrage over comments he made on US television about notorious abduction and murder of Jean McConville . Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has described the notorious abduction and murder of Jean McConville as 'what happens in wars'. In an interview on US television, he sparked outrage by suggesting that incidents like Mrs McConville\u2019s murder happened \u2018in every single conflict\u2019. The comments have angered relatives of Mrs McConville, whose abduction, disappearance and subsequent murder became one of the most shocking events of The Troubles. She was 37 when she was taken by a masked gang from her home in Belfast in front of her children. She was accused by republicans of being a British Army informer, suffocated with a plastic bag and shot dead. Her remains were eventually discovered by a dog walker buried in a dune on Shelling Hill Beach in County Louth in 2003, ending decades of torment for her relatives and enabling them to finally give her a proper burial. Last year Mr Adams, who has long denied he was even in the IRA, was arrested by police investigating Mrs McConville\u2019s murder. He denied any involvement and was released without charge. But then last month, the influential American magazine the New Yorker named Gerry Adams as a former IRA commander who personally passed \u2018death sentences\u2019 on its enemies. It published a damning 15,000-word assessment of allegations against him and claimed that Adams himself issued the order to \u2018disappear\u2019 Mrs McConville. The mother-of-ten, pictured with three of her children, disappeared from her Belfast home in 1972 . In an interview with CBS this weekend, Mr Adams insisted that he did not know about Mrs McConville\u2019s killing. He said that he only reported himself to the police last year after a \u2018tsunami of stories\u2019 about his alleged involvement that were based on reports of interviews given by former IRA paramilitaries to Boston College in the US. Mr Adams said: \u2018They (the police) said that I was a senior manager of the IRA at managerial level so I\u2019m bound to have known. I told them I didn\u2019t. In the preview of the interview, which will be shown in full on Sunday, CBS presenter Scott Pelley said: \u2018It was known to the IRA and you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t know? Mr Adams said: \u2018Yes\u2019 McConville's daughter Helen McKendry described Gerry Adams as having 'blood on his hands' Mr Pelley asked: \u2018How do you orphan 10 children? What kind of depravity is that?\u2019 Mr Adams said: \u2018That\u2019s what happens in wars, Scott. \u2018That\u2019s not to minimize it, but that\u2019s what American soldiers do, British soldiers do, Irish Republican soldiers do, that\u2019s what happens in every single conflict.\u2019 The comments sparked anger from Mrs McConville\u2019s family. Helen McKendry, now a grandmother, was one of the 10 McConville children orphaned when she was suffocated with a plastic bag and shot in the head. She said: \u2018He\u2019s a liar ... I would like Gerry Adams to stand up and admit he played a part. \u2018This man has blood on his hands and I want him to pay for what he did.\u2019 Mr Adams\u2019 arrest last May caused uproar among his supporters and, in his view threatened the peace in Northern Ireland that he helped broker with the Good Friday agreement in 1998. In the CBS interview, Mr Adams said he decided to contact the police himself because he was \u2018sick, sore and tired of a tsunami of stories based upon these tapes linking me to Mrs McConville\u2019s death\u2019. Mr Adams told CBS that he never pulled a trigger, ordered a murder or set off a bomb during The Troubles. He said: \u2018I don\u2019t disassociate myself from the IRA. I think the IRA was a legitimate response to what was happening here. \u2018I never will (disassociate himself from the IRA). But I was not a member of the IRA.\u2019",

    "source": "With Saturday's fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao billed as the $300million fight of the century, it's no surprise that its pay-per-view figures look set to blow previous bouts out of the water. In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (\u00a359) and $99.99 (\u00a366) to watch the fight while in Britain, Sky Box Office is offering the bout for \u00a319.99, but those figures will equate to a small fraction of the earnings for Mayweather and Pacquiao. Once ticket sales and casino profits have been considered, the eagerly anticipated mega-fight, which is due to take place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, will become the biggest pay-per-view in sport and could see the two fighters pocket astronomical sums. This Sports Interaction graphic shows how much Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao stand to earn . American boxing legend Mike Tyson features in four of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights . The eagerly-anticipated mega-fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao is just days away . Canadian data crunchers Sports Interaction\u00a0have put together all the big numbers to find out who will earn what, the top 10 pay-per-view bouts by earnings and whether the  event will give fans value for money. Firstly, let's take a look at how much Mayweather and Pacquiao stand to earn should the showpiece fight go the distance on May 2. 12 rounds of jousting will give Mayweather a stunning $170m (\u00a3111m) purse, meaning the 38-year-old will be picking up $15m (\u00a39m) per round and $5m (\u00a33m) per minute. His opponent stands to earn slightly less and could bank almost $95m (\u00a362m) which boils down to a tidy $8.4m (\u00a35m) per round. Pacquiao gets in his last workout in Los Angeles before heading to Las Vegas on Monday . Mayweather has featured in three of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights to date . The average payout for the top 10 pay-per-view fighters stands at $22.4m (\u00a314m) Mayweather tends to give his viewers values for money by going the distance during his fights . Six of the top 10 pay-per-view events have gone the distance, which is encouraging news for fans across the globe who will be paying to tune in. Although the Las Vegas mega-fight is set to eclipse the highest grossing bouts to date, there will still be one man that can claim to have featured in more of the top 10 duels than Mayweather. Mike Tyson featured in four of the top 10 grossing bouts, ahead of 'Money' Mayweather and Evander Holyfield who have both featured in three. Mayweather's lucrative victory against Saul Alvarez in 2013 looks set to be eclipsed by his next bout . The American poses for photos with singer Justin Bieber after defeating Alvarez in Las Vegas . Oscar De La Hoya has featured in two, while Lennox Lewis, Miguel Cotto, Saul Alvarez, Peter McNeeley, Shane Moseley, Felix Trinidad, George Foreman and Pacquiao have all featured in one. Tyson may have featured in more of the top fights, but it's Mayweather who is currently sitting pretty at the top of the pile after his pay-per-view 12-round fight against Alvarez in September, 2013 saw the American collect a total close to $140m (\u00a391m). Pacquiao features only once in the current list after earning around $555,555 per minute for his victory against Shane Moseley in 2011. Mike Tyson's heavyweight bout against Lennox Lewis (right) in 2002, grossed\u00a0$112m (\u00a373m) Tyson looks on after being knocked down for a final time by Lewis after just eight rounds . Tyson's biggest earner came after his defeat against British legend Lennox Lewis as the pair claimed $760,869 (\u00a3497,796) per minute each after eight rounds. Tyson is also responsible for the first and second most economically inefficient fights inside our top 10. In 1997, his constant biting of Holyfield saw him disqualified at the end of the third round, resulting in that pay-per-view event costing fans $5.59 (\u00a33.60) a minute for the action. Those still deciding whether whether to fork out for Saturday's fight may be swayed by the fact that each fight inside the top 10 grossing bouts that has involved Mayweather or Pacquiao has gone the distance. Tyson is also responsible for the second most economically inefficient fight for fans after being disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield in the third round during the WBA heavyweight clash in 1997 . Holyfield reacts after Tyson bit his ear during the third round of their heavyweight fight in Las Vegas .",

    "source": "Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has revealed the team may have to make 'an unpopular call' for their drivers in light of Ferrari's revival this season. Following the first three races of the new Formula One season it is clear Mercedes will not have it all their own way as Ferrari appear poised to push them all the way. Wolff's remark also comes in the wake of Nico Rosberg's moaning over the team radio during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix about how slow team-mate Lewis Hamilton was driving. Toto Wolff (left) says Nico Rosberg (right) and Lewis Hamilton will have to deal with some 'unpopular calls' Rosberg then turned on Hamilton during the post-race press conference, accusing the world champion of being selfish. Hamilton insisted he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race, with the 30-year-old exonerated of any wrongdoing by Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda. But Wolff has confirmed that with pressure from Ferrari, rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season, there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other. The British driver won the Chinese grand prix but has come under fire from his Mercedes team-mate . 'It may be if we are risking a win against Ferrari we would make an unpopular call, not to freeze everything, but manage them more,' Wolff said. 'Our number one objective, which is what we have decided with the drivers, is we have a big responsibility to the team and the brand. 'It's not just about those two guys - it's about the thousand people working on those cars. 'If it gets to the point where we have to interfere between the two of them because we risk losing a race win, then we would do that. Hamiltonhas won two of the three Formula One races this season and looks to be at the top of his game . 'We don't have the gap that we did last year where we can just let them push each other until the very end. We need to manage the gaps.' Suggested to Wolff he was risking Mercedes' DNA as racers - something he has insisted all along would never be tampered with - he replied: 'It depends on what you do. 'We have seen in the past a clear team order that has stated 'you are not allowed to overtake' even though the driver behind may be faster, for example. 'This is not something I can honestly see happening. Ferrari and Sebastian Vettel have proved surprise tough competition in the race for the Championship .

The body of Charmain Adusah, 41, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days. Her husband, Eric Isaiah Adusah, a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher, was alleged to have left the hotel hurriedly on the day she is believed to have died. Whirlwind romance: Charmain and Eric Adusah, who were married last September, were said to have argued during stay, according to local reports . He told hotel managers at the time that his three-month pregnant wife was ill and did not want to be disturbed. A close family friend claimed last night that Mr Adusah, 28, flew back to London but later returned to Ghana after his wife\u2019s body was found by concerned hotel staff who used a spare key to check on her after she failed to answer the door. Mr Adusah, originally from Ghana, is being held in police custody in the African country on suspicion of murdering the former NHS radiography assistant, whom he married suddenly last September \u2013 following a whirlwind romance \u2013 in a wedding which shocked her family and friends. His wife, whose maiden name was Speirs, already had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship in Wales. Christmas wishes: The couple pictured on a Christmas card. Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010 . But the boy has not yet been told the awful news and was staying with his father, a British man, last night. Mr Adusah is the leader of Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, north London and has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. He has led sermons he describes as \u2018divine visitation\u2019 events across the UK and Ireland, receiving \u00a31million in charitable donations in five years and giving sermons on religious satellite television channels. A close family friend last night accused Mr Adusah of being a \u2018wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u2019, telling The Mail on Sunday: \u2018We think he brainwashed her.\u2019 Mrs Adusah \u2013 who was considered the \u2018First Lady\u2019 of her husband\u2019s ministry \u2013 grew up in Arbroath in Scotland, and studied a degree in photojournalism at Swansea University. She worked as a radiography assistant in the Welsh NHS and later separated from the father of her son. She was described as a \u2018free spirit\u2019 who started following Mr Adusah\u2019s church around two years ago. They started a relationship early last year and married in September in London. The couple had travelled to Ghana early this month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious conference hosted by controversial evangelist \u2018Bishop\u2019 John Yaw Adu, who has been exposed for chaining up mentally ill patients at \u2018prayer camps\u2019 for days on end so he could \u2018heal\u2019 them through prayer. Local reports claim Mr Adusah and his wife had argued at the start of the trip and he had booked himself into a budget motel alone, leaving her to stay with Bishop Yaw Adu. Happier times:\u00a0The body of Charmain Adusah, left, was discovered by hotel staff face down in a bath. Husband\u00a0Eric Isaiah Adusah is being held on suspicion of her murder . Arrest:\u00a0Eric Isaiah Adusah, a Ghanaian British based Pastor, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his pregnant British wife Charmain Spears . After the conference ended, the couple apparently reconciled and checked into the Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua, where they booked in for five days on March 16. The upmarket hotel has security gates and tropical gardens. The couple were said to have argued over the length of their stay, according to the reports, with Mrs Adusah apparently wanting to stay in Ghana for a month but her husband saying it was far too long. Mr Adusah is said to have left the hotel at dawn the next day and warned reception that his wife did not want to be disturbed. But hotel managers became concerned when she still had not left the room and would not respond to knocks on the door. On March 20 hotel porters used a spare key to gain access to the room. A spokesman for Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at the police headquarters in Koforidua said Mrs Adusah was \u2018found dead in the bath lying prostrate with a white towel wrapped around her, almost in a decomposed state\u2019. Her close friend Christine Stephen, 42, of Camberley, Surrey, who has known Mrs Adusah since childhood, told The Mail on Sunday that the family did not hear about her death until March 21. She said: \u2018I spoke to Charmain\u2019s family and they said Eric had been in touch on that Saturday to say she had died. He said he was flying back to Ghana to identify her body on Sunday. Tragic: Charmain Adusah was found face down in a bath by hotel staff in Ghana . The Global Light Revival Ministries, founded by Eric Adusah in 2010, is a revivalist evangelical movement registered as a British charity and has received more than \u00a31m in donations. It hosts gatherings across the UK and Ireland . He also told them he had returned to England because he had a three-day church event he had to attend here. But he was vague about the details of what happened, saying she had wanted to remain out there to help underprivileged children. \u2018Charmain\u2019s family couldn\u2019t get hold of him after that Saturday, presumably because he had been arrested back in Ghana.\u2019 Mrs Stephen said none of her friends took to him. \u2018We thought he tried to cut her off from us, that he had brain-washed her. What person declares himself a prophet? Charmain was religious but she wasn\u2019t a pastor.\u2019 Mrs Stephen said the family wants to go to Ghana and repatriate their daughter\u2019s body but they cannot afford it. Charmain\u2019s mother Linda Speirs, 61, last night said she had been given legal advice not to comment. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u2018We confirm the death of a British national in Ghana. Mr Adusah has not requested consular assistance.\u2019 A representative of Mr Adusah\u2019s church said: \u2018There is no story. She died of natural causes.\u2019 Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.",

The Northern Territory\u2019s Chief Minister Adam Giles and Minister for Children and Families John Elferink\u00a0made the threat after a recent rise in youth crime in Alice Springs surrounding the Easter holidays. \u2018I\u2019m giving the parents of the children responsible for this spate of violence a very clear message. Get your kids off the streets. Get them back to communities and back into school,\u2019 Mr Giles said. Mr Elferink threatened: \u2018If parents don\u2019t want to see their children in care then they need to get off the grog and head back to their home community.\u2019 In a media statement titled \u2018strong consequences for Alice Springs rock throwers\u2019 the government stated \u2018the current situation would not be tolerated\u2019. \u2018These children will be regarded as requiring protection and we will take immediate action. Parents should not doubt our resolve to do this,\u2019 Mr Giles added. Northern territory\u2019s Chief Minister Adam Giles said parents should not doubt his 'resolve' to take their children into the hands of child protection services . Parents will also be fined $298 if their child is found on the streets during school hours. The manager of Jesuit Social Services in Alice Springs, John Adams, told ABC radio the government's announcement was a 'knee-jerk' reaction. 'Removing kids is never the best response to such an issue,' he said. On Monday night, 42 people were taken into protective custody and 34 young people were driven home after a group of 50 young people threw \u2018large rocks\u2019 at police. Northern Territory Police Superintendent Travis Wurst said none of the group have been identified but \u2018the main protagonist of the incident is described as a male aged in his late teens/early twenties, of Aboriginal appearance.\u2019 On Tuesday night no rocks were thrown at police but 34 people were taken into protective custody and 77 youths were conveyed home, while three youths were arrested for trespassing. This window was smashed in Alice Springs during the spate of rock throwing in the Northern Territory . Mr Giles (left) and\u00a0Minister for Children and Families John Elferink (right) made the threat after a recent rise in youth crime in Alice Springs surrounding the Easter holidays . On Monday night 42 people were taken into protective custody and 34 young people were driven home after a group of 50 young people threw \u2018large rocks\u2019 at police . On Wednesday night, the crime spree appeared to calm. A Northern Territory police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: \u2018We only received couple of reports of rock throwing near Anzac Hill and no reports of damage.\u2019 There were 29 youths driven home by police as officers stepped up their police presence to deter anti-social behaviour. Superintendent Wurst said: \u2018The reduction of property damage and rock throwing is encouraging and police will continue to target anti-social behaviour to ensure a safe environment for the people of Alice Springs.\u2019 A NT Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: \u2018No police officers have been harmed by the rock throwing.\u2019 'No police officers have been harmed by the rock throwing,' a NT police spokesperson said . They said incidences of rock throwing had calmed down and that it wasn't a \u2018regular occurrence\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s more since the Easter Holidays and the carnival has been here,\u2019 the police spokesperson said. Minister  Elferink, who is in Alice Springs assessing the situation, said: \u2018I have directed my department to take strong action and take children into care where the legal grounds are met. 'Normally the department would see this as a last resort and be willing to work with parents but these are not normal circumstances.\u2019 \u2018Gangs of youth throwing rocks at police officers is not normal and is illegal. It\u2019s an extreme circumstance and will bring a zero tolerance approach for this kind of behaviour.\u2019",

These were the scenes that greeted Animal Liberation Victoria activists who broke into Wagner's Poultry Farm in Coldstream in March. The photographs they took at the Yarra Valley farm give a chilling insight into the bleak world of caged chicken factories. Scroll down for video . Some of the hens found at Wagner's Poultry Farm were ravaged and dying . Some looked as if they had only a few days left to live such was their condition . Eggs were still being produced at the farm despite the poorly hens . Activists said they found birds living in terrible conditions. Amazingly, two weeks earlier government health officials inspected the farm, but gave it the all clear. However, several hens were in such a bad state that they had to be removed from the cages by the activists as they were in desperate need of veterinary care. 'During multiple investigations in March, our rescue team discovered deformed, sick and dying hens, filthy conditions and immensely dangerous working conditions, which are now being investigated by Worksafe,'\u00a0Noah Hannibal president of Animal Liberation Victoria told Daily Mail Australia. Hens continue to lay eggs despite a dead carcase lying in the cage beneath them . Animal Liberation Victoria activists look through the cages to see how healthy the hens are . 'Photos and video were taken of hens with eyeballs hanging out, with mangled beaks, and completely defeathered hens. 'Hens spend over a year in small wire cages, as is standard practice in the egg industry. When they are no longer 'profitable' they are sent to the slaughterhouse. 'Our rescue team found many hens in urgent need of veterinary attention, who were clearly not receiving any care.' But the owner of the 6000-bird farm that sells caged, free-range chicken and duck eggs has denied claims that the animals were not being cared for properly. Two dead hen carcases are just left on the floor of the caged chicken farm . Dirt and dust hang from the hen cages that look as if they haven't been cleaned for ages . Wagner\u2019s Poultry is a family business that has been operating for over 50 years. \u2018Wagner\u2019s is regularly inspected by the Department of Primary Industries alongside a veterinary practitioner to ensure Wagner\u2019s meets all regulatory requirements and adheres to the industries code of practice,\u2019 the company said in a statement. \u2018At no time has the industry regulator raised concerns with the animal husbandry practices on Wagner\u2019s property. \u2018Wagner\u2019s Chicken Picken shed has been specifically designed to ensure that all our poultry is selected in a stress-free environment rather than being chased and caught in the paddock.\u2019 Nothing to see here: One hen with a mangled beak looks forlornly out through its cage . Hundreds of hens stand in rows of cages as they lay eggs in pretty dire conditions . Dirty and emaciated hens stand in their cages with no room to move . The government department responsible for animal welfare in commercial facilities also confirmed two recent inspections did not find any breaches under animal cruelty laws. However, Mr Hannibal maintained that not only is the farm a hell hole for hens, it is also extremely unsafe for workers. 'Narrow and flimsy walkways next to the central cages drop directly into manure pits below,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'This presents a huge danger to any humans working in the shed who are at risk of falling down to the excrement pit a floor below - when they attempt to populate and depopulate the cages, or carry out the \u2018daily inspection\u2019 required by law. An Animal Liberation Victoria activist lifts up one of the hens to show how bad it looks . Another Animal Liberation Victoria activist takes a dirty and exhausted hen from one of the cages . Webs and dirt hang from the ceiling and cages where the hens as an Animal Liberation Victoria activist looks on in shock . 'Many people consider free range eggs to be an ethical alternative to these cruel battery systems that are in operation. 'But consumers should realise that all eggs, whether they are caged, barn or 'free range', cause enormous suffering and death.'",

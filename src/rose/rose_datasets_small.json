Gardner has enjoyed a successful loan spell at Nottingham Forest and scored a superb free-kick in front of the Villa manager during the defeat to Watford at the City Ground. Sherwood is keen to see Gardner, a former England Under-21 player, train day-to-day before making up his mind and he has spoken previously about his desire for homegrown players to make an impact at the club. Gary Gardner (left) will report to Aston Villa for pre-season training to be assessed by Tim Sherwood . The Villa boss has inspired the club since being appointed and helped lead them to an FA Cup final . Gardner, born in Solihull, joined Villa's academy aged seven and last year was rewarded with a new contract that expires in June 2016 despite suffering serious knee injuries. 'I will go back to Villa in the summer and we will see what happens,' he said. 'When I am back there in training, it will be my chance to impress. Tim Sherwood will not have seen much of me in training, because I have not been there. 'Villa are the main club, I have been there since I was seven and it is the team I support. But Forest have been fantastic to me. It is definitely the second team in my heart. 'If I was made available for loan again next season, if it does not work out at Villa, Forest would be top of my list, definitely. It is the best loan move I have had.'

      "source": "For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.",

      "source": "It is the smallest computer in the world - and 150 of them can fit in a thimble. Called the Michigan Micro Mote, to tiny technology is a complete computer system. Its inventors say it can act as a smart sensor, and give everyday objects computing capabilities. The Michigan Micro Mote is the smallest computer in the world, measuring less than 2mm across. The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. By strobing light at a high frequency, the operator is able to send information to the computer. Once the Micro Mote processes the data, it is able to send the information to a central computer via conventional radio frequencies. The Michigan Micro Mote is the first complete, operational computer system measuring as small as two millimeters across. 'To be 'complete,' a computer system must have an input of data, the ability to process that data - meaning process and store it, make decisions about what to do next – and ultimately, the ability to output the data.' Professor David Blaauw explained. 'The sensors are the input and the radios are the output. The other key to being a complete computer is the ability to supply its own power.' The Michigan Micro Mote contains solar cells that power the battery with ambient light, including indoor rooms with no natural sunlight, allowing the computers to run perpetually. This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. They are the culmination of work initiated by Blaauw and Sylvester on very low-power processing for millimeter-scale systems. A key breakthrough in the size/power matchup came with the Phoenix processor in 2008. The Phoenix processor is miniscule at 915 x 915µm2, and boasts ultra-low operating voltage and a unique standby mode that results in an average power consumption of only 500pW. (Consider that 1pW is the average power consumption of a single human cell.) Blaauw explained why Phoenix's extreme energy efficiency is so important: 'As you shrink down in size, the percentage of the system tends to be dominated by the battery. 'It's actually not hard to make chips small, but it is hard to make them low power. 'We could have very small chips, but we'd still end up with really large batteries.' This line of 'smart dust' devices includes computers equipped with imagers (with motion detection), temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information, its inventors say. The solar system allows the computer to work  under indoor lights without ever having to be charged. 'With a 1mm2 solar cell producing 20nW, the device can harvest enough energy under ambient light to run perpetually,' the team say. The device's standby power consumption is 2nA. That's about a million times less power than the average mobile phone consumes while on standby, or the comparative difference between the thickness of a sheet of paper and the length of a football field. There are currently three different systems in the M3 family, focusing on several different applications: sensing temperature, pressure, and taking images. 'Down the road we want these sensors to be able to talk to one another,' says Blaauw, 'and we're currently working to extend their range to about 20m.' The working computer is smaller than a grain of rice programmed and charged via light and could be used for a variety of medical and industrial purposes. One key application for this line of smart sensors lies in personal security and information. Numerous specks of technology could be discretely placed to invisibly monitor a home, business, or personal device. 'We found that a lot of people were very interested in these devices, and that's why we went with the modular or stacked approach.' Blaauw explained. 'It's the key aspect of our design. If you need a different sensing modality you take out one sensor and replace it with another - like mix and match tinker toys.'",

      "source": "Zinedine Zidane joined in the clamour for the highly-rated midfielder Paul Pogba by claiming it is 'only logical' that Real Madrid want him on board at the Bernabeu. The France international, who is currently nursing a hamstring injury, extended his contract with the Old Lady until the end of the 2018-19 season back in October, however he has been consistently linked with a move away from Turin. The 22-year-old has attracted interest from a number of top European clubs, with Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Madrid all being tipped as potential suitors. Real Madrid Castilla coach Zinedine Zidane is not shocked by his club's interest in compatriot Paul Pogba . Pogba has been a key figure for Juventus this season and is a much sought after talent throughout Europe . Keen on a return to the Premier League, Pogba is reported to be part of a £100million summer wishlist at former club United and is also understood to have been closely monitored by Manchester City and Chelsea. With so much attention surrounding the young star - who has netted seven goals in 22 Serie A appearances this season - Zidane feels such interest should not come as a surprise to those aware of his talents. Juventus midfielder and former United player Pogba is also on Louis van Gaal's radar at Old Trafford . 'When we are talking about a player like Pogba, it is only logical Real Madrid are interested in signing him,' Zidane told French channel Canal+. 'He is a player with immense potential, who still has an important margin for improvement. 'He is still young and has an exciting future ahead of him. 'Where Pogba will play next season? I don't know the answer to that question. You will have to ask him.'",

      "source": "Andal Ampatuan Junior is accused of orchestrating the murder of 57 unarmed civilians, who were ambushed, killed and clumsily buried in a mass grave in the southern province of Maguindanao last November.\nAnother 27 members of his family have also been charged in connection with the killings - five are with him in custody - and they all deny the charges against them.\nBut for many Filipinos, this trial is about much more than establishing the guilt or innocence of one man, or even one family.\nIt's about the huge influence of clans like the Ampatuans, and the culture of impunity surrounding them.\nWhile their involvement in the massacre has yet to be proven, there is no doubt whatsoever that the Ampatuans were - and still are - extremely powerful.\nThe Ampatuans have been in Maguindanao for centuries, and can trace their lineage to a Muslim preacher, Shariff Aguak, who was one of the first people to bring the Islamic faith to the area.\nBut they were not always the dominant force they are today. According to Arnold Esguerra, a history professor at the University of the Philippines in Manila, the surname Ampatuan only started to appear in official documents in the early part of the 20th Century.\nAt that stage they were influential traders, he said - but their social status was definitely beneath that of the \"datus\", the traditional clan rulers.\nThe situation changed in the mid-1970s, when then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, and tried to stamp out the growing Islamic separatist movement by selecting a few people he could trust to administer the province.\nOne of those people was Andal Ampatuan Junior's father, Andal Senior, who is now the undisputed head of the family clan.\nFirst, he became the mayor of Maganoy town - and then, during the presidency of Cory Aquino, he was given the more powerful role of officer-in-charge.\nBut it was under President Gloria Arroyo, who came to power in 2001, when the Ampatuans really came to prominence.\nAndal Senior became governor of Maguindanao, a post he has now held for the maximum three terms.  Then in 2005 his son Zaldy became the governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao - an influential post controlling the five Muslim provinces that have been given a degree of self-rule from central government.\n'Heights of power'\nAndal Junior became mayor of Datu Unsay, a town that bears his nickname, and at the time of the massacre, 10 of Maguindanao's 34 municipalities were run by Ampatuans or their relatives.\nMrs Arroyo's government was good to the Ampatuans, providing funds for the region, and in the process propelling Andal Senior to \"undreamed-of heights of power\", according to a report by the International Crisis Group.\nIn 2006, Mrs Arroyo issued an executive order legalising the informal private \"armies\" being kept by families like the Ampatuans, enabling them to work alongside the regular army - but by extension legitimising their use as a means of local control.\nIn return the Ampatuans openly supported her in election campaigns.\nThere are widespread claims that the family helped rig votes for Mrs Arroyo in the controversial 2004 election, which she narrowly won. Both the Ampatuans and the former president deny the allegations.\nAt the time of the massacre, the clan had an estimated 28 mansions, scores of luxury cars, large amounts of rice-producing land and a heavily armed private army of more than 2,000 men.\nAccording to the International Crisis Group, the Ampatuans also controlled the police, the judiciary and the local election commission, and possessed mortars, rocket launchers and assault rifles.\nEven now, after the finger of blame has been pointed at them for the November massacre, the family still retains a lot of its influence. At least 15 Ampatuans won victories in May's election - some of whom have charges against them.\nAnd according to Jessica Evans from Human Rights Watch, Andal Senior is still able to give orders to his subordinates from inside jail.\nOf course none of this means the Ampatuans are necessarily guilty of the killings, or that all members of the clan act in a similar way.\nIn fact, according to Amina Rasul, director of the Philippine Council on Islam and Democracy, some Ampatuans are very effective and popular community leaders.\n\"They're not all cut from the same cloth. Many are professional, and have real support,\" she said.\nBut human rights groups are still concerned about the dominance of these family clans, and they warn that the influence and power exhibited by the Ampatuans is by no means unique.\n\"I don't think this is an isolated incident,\" said Amina Rasul. \"There are other families in other parts of the Philippines that are just as powerful.\"\nThe Philippine military recently admitted that there were at least 112 private armies around the country - an indication, perhaps, of how many more clans and family groups hold sway over their own private fiefdoms.\nWhether by chance or design, presidential policies over the past few decades have given certain families the opportunity to amass extraordinary levels of power and influence.\nThe first priority of the trial into last November's massacre is undoubtedly to bring justice for those who were so brutally killed.\nBut human rights groups are hoping that the case will also persuade the current government, under President Benigno Aquino, to bring an end to the dominance of families like the Ampatuans.",

It's equivalent to about 19% of the reported profits before tax of the big five UK banks over the 12 months to September this year - although the tax burden will be borne by more than just these five.\nWhat's risky about the type of borrowing that the government wants to discourage?\nTraditionally, most of the money that banks lend out comes from the deposits they receive from ordinary people and companies.\nBut during the past decade, banks found new and more complex ways to borrow trillions of pounds from international markets.\nUnlike ordinary deposits, there is no natural limit on the availability of this money, as it can come from anywhere in the globe, and the same money can be recycled between the banks again and again.\nA lot of the debts created were very short-term - meaning the banks needed to go back to the markets to reborrow every few days.\nWhen the financial crisis hit, investors began to worry that banks might not be able to repay their debts.\nThis caused a kind of bank run, with investors refusing to lend.\nUnable to refinance all of their short-term debts, even profitable banks were threatened with failure.\nWhy are retail deposits exempt from the levy?\nBank runs are popularly associated with long queues of ordinary depositors wanting to empty their bank accounts - just as happened to Northern Rock.\nBut since the 1930s, governments have insured most of the money deposited by their citizens in order to discourage these depositor bank runs. Indeed, the government responded to the Northern Rock crisis by promising to guarantee all of its deposits.\nIn the UK, the first £85,000 of an individual's money is insured (it used to be £35,000 before the financial crisis).\nThis means that most depositors do not need to worry about the safety of their money during a financial crisis, and the banks don't need to worry about all those deposits being withdrawn.\nSo why not just insure all the banks' borrowings?\nThe bank levy was actually first proposed to all countries by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a type of insurance scheme.\nThe IMF said the money raised should be channelled into a special fund that could be used to pay for the cost of cleaning up future banking crises.\nHowever, the UK government took the view that these borrowings are inherently risky, and wanted to discourage them altogether by taxing them.\nIf the debts were insured, lenders would see them as less risky, making them a cheaper and easier way for banks to borrow.\nThe government's fear is that the banks would then just continue taking on more and more debt, until they became impossibly large to rescue - as proved the case in the Republic of Ireland or Iceland.\nIndeed, the total debts of the UK's banks had already reached a staggering 4.5 times the size of the entire UK economy before the crisis.\nSome might also point out another reason why the government chose not to go for an insurance scheme.\nBy making it a tax instead, the revenue raised can be channelled straight to the Treasury, helping to pay for the government's own spending.\nWhy is the first £20bn of debts exempt from the tax?\nThe government wants to encourage banks to shrink.\nThe thinking is that the collapse of a big bank could threaten the stability of the entire financial system, whereas the failure of a small bank should not.\nThe £20bn figure is about the size of the Coventry Building Society. So it means banks will only pay the tax to the extent they are bigger than that.\nWhy is the tax rate lower on long-term debts?\nLonger-term debts are inherently less risky.\nFinancial crises - at least the most intense part of them - tend to be over in a matter of a few weeks or months.\nIf a bank does not have to repay its debts for more than a year, then it can probably ride out the crisis.\nWill the levy really discourage banks?\nThe tax will increase the cost of \"risky\" short-term borrowing for banks by just under one-tenth of a percentage point.\nThis may seem small, but it will eat into the banks' precious margins - the difference between the interest they pay on their deposits and what they earn on their lending - which is their main source of income.\nHowever, the banks may pass some of the tax cost on to their savers (via a lower deposit rate) or their borrowers (via a higher lending rate).\nBut to get the 0.088% in context, the Bank of England slashed short-term borrowing costs by 5.2 percentage points in response to the financial crisis.\nWhy did the government want to phase the levy in?\nThe original plan was to charge 0.05% for 2011, before going up to the full 0.075% rate next year (increased to 0.078% in March).\nThe government didn't want to raise the banks' borrowing costs at a time when their financial stability was still in question.\nThey also did not want to sap the banks' profits too quickly.\nThe banks might need to use all the profits they could get to rebuild their capital - their buffer against future losses - in order to meet tough new international standards being set by the Basel committee of banking regulators.\nSo why did the government change its mind?\nIn February, the Treasury said it wanted to charge the full £2.6bn this year after all.\nIt pointed to the Bank of England's latest Financial Stability Report, which painted a much rosier picture of the UK's banks.\nMoreover, the new Basel rules on bank capital won't take full effect until 2019, giving banks a full eight years to meet the higher standards.\nIt probably also helped that the banks have been reporting much better profits than many would have expected a year ago.\nAnd markets seemed less and less concerned about the risk of lending to banks - at least until the eurozone debt crisis flared up since the summer of 2011.\nWhy is the government raising the rate again?\nThe chancellor raised the rate to 0.088% in his Autumn Statement.\nAccording to the Treasury, the tax was not on course to raise the £2.6bn originally planned for this year.\nThe Treasury said that it had simply overestimated how much borrowing is done by foreign banks in the UK - and is therefore subject to the tax.\nIt could also be that banks have been reducing their borrowing. Foreign banks may be moving their borrowing offshore to avoid the tax.\nAnd all banks may be cutting back their borrowing and lending requirements in response to the recession, the eurozone financial crisis, and stricter regulatory requirements.\nWhich banks will have to pay most?\nThe Treasury does not say how much of its £2.6bn target it expects to be paid by each bank.\nBritish banks face a bigger burden than foreign banks that do business in the UK, because the British banks must pay the levy on all their borrowing worldwide, and not just on their borrowing in the UK.\nThat has led to suggestions that some banks - perhaps Standard Chartered, HSBC and Barclays - may relocate their headquarters to another country in order to reduce their tax bill.\nMoreover, the probability is that the tax will hit Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group hardest.\nIt may seem perverse to tax most heavily the two banks in which the government has the biggest stake.\nBut one of the reasons the government ended up owning these banks is precisely because they (in the case of Lloyds, because of its merger with the Halifax) had become too dependent on riskier forms of financing, and had to be rescued during the crisis.",
